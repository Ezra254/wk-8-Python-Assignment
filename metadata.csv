Indiscriminate use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has seriously affected this situation. With the diminishing discovery of novel antibiotics, new treatment methods are urgently required to combat MDR pathogens. Polymyxins, the cationic lipopeptide antibiotics, discovered more than half a century ago, are considered to be the last-line of antibiotics available at the moment. This antibiotic shows a great bactericidal effect against Gram-negative bacteria. Polymyxins primarily target the bacterial membrane and disrupt them, causing lethality. Because of their membrane interacting mode of action, polymyxins cause nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity in humans, limiting their usability. However, recent modifications in their chemical structure have been able to reduce the toxic effects. The development of better dosing regimens has also helped in getting better clinical outcomes in the infections caused by MDR pathogens. Since the mid-1990s the use of polymyxins has increased manifold in clinical settings, resulting in the emergence of polymyxin-resistant strains. The risk posed by the polymyxin-resistant nosocomial pathogens such as the Enterobacteriaceae group, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii, etc. is very serious considering these pathogens are resistant to almost all available antibacterial drugs. In this review article, the mode of action of the polymyxins and the genetic regulatory mechanism responsible for the emergence of resistance are discussed. Specifically, this review aims to update our current understanding in the field and suggest possible solutions that can be pursued for future antibiotic development. As polymyxins primarily target the bacterial membranes, resistance to polymyxins arises primarily by the modification of the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the outer membrane (OM). The LPS modification pathways are largely regulated by the bacterial two-component signal transduction (TCS) systems. Therefore, targeting or modulating the TCS signalling mechanisms can be pursued as an alternative to treat the infections caused by polymyxin-resistant MDR pathogens. In this review article, this aspect is also highlighted.",2021-08-26,"Mohapatra, Saswat S; Dwibedy, Sambit K; Padhy, Indira",J Biosci,,document_parses/pdf_json/b69a193b77cac55613046603f12015d2fe4ebcfc.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8387214/,,2021,317

While temporary policy changes to the programs enabled school food authorities (SFAs) to pivot towards distributing meals throughout their communities instead of within school buildings, SFAs faced complex challenges during COVID-19 with minimal external support. This mixed methods study investigates the implementation and financial challenges experienced by twelve of the largest urban SFAs in the U.S. during COVID-19. We conducted semi-structured interviews with SFA leaders and analyzed alongside quantitative financial data. We found that SFAs reconfigured their usual operations with nearly no preparation time while simultaneously trying to keep staff from contracting COVID-19, accommodate stakeholders with sometimes competing priorities, and remain financially solvent. Because student participation was much lower than during regular times, and revenue is tied to the number of meals served, SFAs saw drastic decreases in revenue even as they carried regular operating costs.

When it comes to contagious diseases, the physical properties of protective clothing are deemed the top priority and, subsequently, they have significant meaning for the structural design, production cost evaluation, convenient production, and innovation. In this study, nonwoven technology is employed to produce matrices in which mechanical properties are supported by Tencel fibers and recycled Kevlar fibers. Next, the electrostatic spinning is conducted to generate breathable and waterproof films. The nonwoven fabrics and membranes are combined to have diverse functions, forming lay-up compound matrices for medical protective clothing. Moreover, measurements are conducted to characterize the lay-up compound matrices in terms of the tensile strength, tearing strength, bursting strength, puncture resistance, stiffness, air-permeable property, surface resistance, comfort performance, sub-micron particulate filtration efficiency, and the penetration of synthetic blood. As for the nonwoven fabrics, the mechanical properties are significantly improved after Kevlar fibers are incorporated. The tensile strength is (62.6 ± 2.4) N along the machine direction (MD) and (50.1 ± 3.1) N along the cross machine direction (CD); the tearing strength is (29.5 ± 1.6) N along the MD and (43.0 ± 1.7) N along the CD; the bursting strength is (365.8 ± 5.0) kPa; and the puncture resistance is (22.6 ± 1.0) N. Moreover, the lay-up compound matrices exhibit a stiffness of (14.7 ± 0.2) cm along the MD and (14.6 ± 0.1) cm along the CD, a surface resistance of (2.85 × 10(9) ± 0.37 × 10(9)) Ω, an air-permeable property of (45.4 ± 2.3) cm(3)/s/cm(2), and sub-micron particulate filtration efficiency of over 98%. In the measurement for penetration of synthetic blood, the K40/PAN/TPU group prevents the synthetic blood from penetration. Hence, the incorporation of recycled Kevlar fibers and lay-up compound technique creates good physical properties, an appropriate comfort attribute, and functions, which suggests that this study provides a greater diversity and new concepts for the production of medical protective clothing.",2022-03-16,"Lou, Ching-Wen; Lin, Jian-Hong; Lai, Mei-Feng; Huang, Chen-Hung; Shiu, Bing-Chiuan; Lin, Jia-Horng",Polymers (Basel),,document_parses/pdf_json/0de7dc4b5e9bea7fb81e1df8d33ffd17ae5977fa.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35335510/; https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14061179,247511117.0,2022,334

It’s most significant feature is cardiac involvement. Methods: We have analyzed data from 42 hospitals in the Polish MIS-C Registry. To compare the effect of GCS on fever, we formed two groups: the first treated with IVIG and the second treated with IVIG+GCS. Results: There were 111 boys and 56 girls; the mean age was 8.57 years. All the patients were treated with IVIG: 76 patients with IVIG only, and 91 patients with IVIG+GCS. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups regarding age, gender, BMI, or inflammatory markers. Methylprednisolone was the most common drug (80%). Echocardiographic abnormalities on admission were more prevalent in the IVIG+GCS group. Mean time from IVIG infusion to subsidence of fever was 1.1 days, and 1.5 for those in the IVIG+GCS group. Conclusions: GCS are commonly used in the treatment of MIS-C patients in Poland. Various GCS regimens are used, from a single dose to a month-long therapy. Children with lower lymphocyte levels and cardiac abnormalities on an echocardiographic examination performed on admission were more likely to receive GCS+IVIG.

Among the available technologies, the chest Computed Tomography (CT) scan is an effective approach for reliable and early detection of the disease. However, it could be difficult to rapidly identify by human inspection anomalous area in CT images belonging to the COVID-19 disease. Hence, it becomes necessary the exploitation of suitable automatic algorithms able to quick and precisely identify the disease, possibly by using few labeled input data, because large amounts of CT scans are not usually available for the COVID-19 disease. The method proposed in this paper is based on the exploitation of the compact and meaningful hidden representation provided by a Deep Denoising Convolutional Autoencoder (DDCAE). Specifically, the proposed DDCAE, trained on some target CT scans in an unsupervised way, is used to build up a robust statistical representation generating a target histogram. A suitable statistical distance measures how this target histogram is far from a companion histogram evaluated on an unknown test scan: if this distance is greater of a threshold, the test image is labeled as anomaly, i.e. the scan belongs to a patient affected by COVID-19 disease. Some experimental results and comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods show the effectiveness of the proposed approach reaching a top accuracy of 100% and similar high values for other metrics. In conclusion, by using a statistical representation of the hidden features provided by DDCAEs, the developed architecture is able to differentiate COVID-19 from normal and pneumonia scans with high reliability and at low computational cost.",2021-12-16,"Scarpiniti, Michele; Sarv Ahrabi, Sima; Baccarelli, Enzo; Piazzo, Lorenzo; Momenzadeh, Alireza",Expert Syst Appl,,document_parses/pdf_json/b1a16fe698ec8106a3ee2bdaecf0fbad5b15cacf.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34937995/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116366; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957417421016614; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417421016614?v=s5,245221018.0,2021,260

Concerns have been raised about whether home confinement may have worsened the burden of myopia owing to substantially decreased time spent outdoors and increased screen time at home. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the refractive changes and prevalence of myopia in school-aged children during the COVID-19 home confinement. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective cross-sectional study using school-based photoscreenings in 123 535 children aged 6 to 13 years from 10 elementary schools in Feicheng, China, was conducted. The study was performed during 6 consecutive years (2015-2020). Data were analyzed in July 2020. EXPOSURES: Noncycloplegic photorefraction was examined using a photoscreener device. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The spherical equivalent refraction was recorded for each child and the prevalence of myopia for each age group during each year was calculated. The mean spherical equivalent refraction and prevalence of myopia were compared between 2020 (after home confinement) and the previous 5 years for each age group. RESULTS: Of the 123 535 children included in the study, 64 335 (52.1%) were boys. A total of 194 904 test results (389 808 eyes) were included in the analysis. A substantial myopic shift (approximately −0.3 diopters [D]) was found in the 2020 school-based photoscreenings compared with previous years (2015-2019) for younger children aged 6 (−0.32 D), 7 (−0.28 D), and 8 (−0.29 D) years. The prevalence of myopia in the 2020 photoscreenings was higher than the highest prevalence of myopia within 2015-2019 for children aged 6 (21.5% vs 5.7%), 7 (26.2% vs 16.2%), and 8 (37.2% vs 27.7%) years. The differences in spherical equivalent refraction and the prevalence of myopia between 2020 and previous years were minimal in children aged 9 to 13 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to be associated with a significant myopic shift for children aged 6 to 8 years according to 2020 school-based photoscreenings.

We find that virtual courtrooms are highly disorganized and fraught with technical malfunctions, compromising defendants’ appearances online, and impeding their ability to confer with counsel and address the court. Defendants with less access to digital platforms and incarcerated individuals are disproportionately impacted.

Impact of exercise on kinetics of serum levels of protein-bound uraemic toxins, known to exert toxicity and to have kinetics dissimilar of those of urea, has so far not been explored. Furthermore, if any effect, the most optimal intensity, time point and/or required duration of intradialytic exercise to maximise removal remain obscure. We therefore studied the impact of different intradialytic cycling schedules on the removal of protein-bound uraemic toxins during haemodialysis (HD).This randomised cross-over study included seven stable patients who were dialysed with an FX800 dialyser during three consecutive midweek HD sessions of 240 min: (A) without cycling; (B) cycling for 60 min between 60th and 120th minutes of dialysis; and (C) cycling for 60 min between 150th and 210th minutes, with the same cycling load as in session B.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize e-cigarette use behaviors among US youth in 2020. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The 2020 National Youth Tobacco Survey, a nationally representative, cross-sectional, school-based survey of middle school (grades 6-8) and high school (grades 9-12) students, was conducted from January 16, 2020, to March 16, 2020. A total of 14 531 students from 180 schools participated in the 2020 survey, yielding a corresponding student-level participation rate of 87.4% and school-level participation rate of 49.9%. The overall response rate, a product of the school-level and student-level participation rates, was 43.6%. EXPOSURES: Current (past 30-day) e-cigarette use. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported current e-cigarette use behaviors (frequency of use, usual e-cigarette brand, and access source) by school level and flavored e-cigarette use and flavor types among current e-cigarette users by school level and device type. Prevalence estimates were weighted to account for the complex survey design. RESULTS: Overall, 14 531 students completed the survey, including 7330 female students and 7133 male students with self-reported grade level and sex. In 2020, 19.6% (95% CI, 17.2%-22.2%) of high school students and 4.7% (95% CI, 3.6%-6.0%) of middle school students reported current e-cigarette use. Among them, 38.9% (95% CI, 35.2%-42.6%) of high school users and 20.0% (95% CI, 16.0%-24.8%) of middle school users reported e-cigarette use on 20 to 30 days within the past 30 days. Among current users, JUUL was the most commonly reported usual brand (high school: 25.4%; 95% CI, 18.8%-33.4%; middle school: 35.1%; 95% CI, 27.9%-43.1%). Among current users, the most common source of obtaining e-cigarettes was from a friend (high school: 57.1%; 95% CI, 52.6%-61.4%; middle school: 58.9%; 95% CI, 51.4%-66.1%). Among current users, 84.7% (95% CI, 82.2%-86.9%) of high school students and 73.9% (95% CI, 66.9%-79.8%) of middle school students reported flavored e-cigarette use. Fruit-flavored e-cigarettes were the most commonly reported flavor among current exclusive e-cigarette users of prefilled pods or cartridges (67.3%; 95% CI, 60.9%-73.0%), disposable e-cigarettes (85.8%; 95% CI, 79.8%-90.3%), and tank-based devices (82.7%; 95% CI, 68.9%-91.1%), followed by mint-flavored e-cigarettes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest that although current e-cigarette use decreased during 2019 to 2020, overall prevalence, frequent use, and flavored e-cigarette use remained high.

The current tests are based on spike (S), the receptor binding domain (RBD), or the nucleoprotein (NP) as substrate. Here, we used samples from a high seroprevalence cohort of health care workers (HCWs) to perform a longitudinal analysis of the antibody responses using three distinct serological assays. 501 serum samples were tested using: a) a research-grade RBD and spike based tandem enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MS-RBD ELISA, MS-spike ELISA), b) a commercial RBD and spike based tandem ELISA (Kantaro-RBD, -spike), and c) a commercial NP-based chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA, Abbott Architect). Seroprevalence ranged around 28% during the early stage of the pandemic (a: 28.4% positives; b: 28.1%; c: 27.3%). Good correlation was observed between the MS and Kantaro RBD ELISAs and between the MS and Kantaro spike ELISAs. By contrast, modest correlations were observed between the Abbott Architect and both RBD and spike-based assays. A proportion of HCWs (n=178) were sampled again 3-5 months after the first time point. Although antibody levels declined in most of the positive individuals, the overall seroprevalence measured by RBD-spike based assays remained unchanged. However the seroprevalence of NP-reactive antibodies significantly declined. Lastly, we tested six samples of individuals who received two doses of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and found that seroconversion was detected by the RBD-spike assays but, of course as expected, not the NP based assay.

We report the biochemical characterization of the Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) full-length recombinant VP35 (rVP35)–dsRNA binding function. We established a novel in vitro magnetic dsRNA binding pull down assay, determined the rVP35 optimal dsRNA binding parameters, measured the rVP35 equilibrium dissociation constant for heterologous in vitro transcribed dsRNA of different length and short synthetic dsRNA of 8 bp, and validated the assay for compound screening by assessing the inhibitory ability of auryntricarboxylic acid (IC(50) value of 50 μg/mL). Furthermore, we compared the dsRNA binding properties of full length wt rVP35 with those of R305A, K309A and R312A rVP35 mutants, which were previously reported to be defective in dsRNA binding-mediated IFN inhibition, showing that the latter have measurably increased K(d) values for dsRNA binding and modified migration patterns in mobility shift assays with respect to wt rVP35.

However, we hypothesized that patients with persistently positive results by RT-PCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could be potentially infectious for a prolonged time, even if immunocompetent and asymptomatic, which would demand a longer social isolation period than presently recommended. To test this hypothesis, 72 samples from 51 mildly symptomatic immunocompetent patients with long-lasting positive rRT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 were tested for their infectiousness in cell culture. The serological response of samples from those patients and virus genomic integrity were also analyzed. Infectious viruses were successfully isolated from 34.38% (22/64) of nasopharynx samples obtained 14 days or longer after symptom onset. Indeed, we observed successful virus isolation up to 128 days. Complete SARS-COV-2 genome integrity was demonstrated, suggesting the presence of replication-competent viruses. No correlation was found between the isolation of infectious viruses and rRT-PCR cycle threshold values or the humoral immune response. These findings call attention to the need to review current isolation guidelines, particularly in scenarios involving high-risk individuals.

The origin of sewage sludge does not exclude the potential presence of pathogens (e.g. Salmonella spp. and SARS-CoV-2) in mature digestate that hence could represent a source of sanitary concerns when it is spread on soil for agriculture purpose. Therefore, an experimental study aimed at proving the sanitizing effect of a full scale thermophilic high solids anaerobic digestion process was conducted by monitoring the hygienic characteristics of mature digestate. Although Salmonella spp. was detected and SARS-CoV-2 was presumably present in the sewage sludge fed to the full scale plant, the anaerobic digestion treatment demonstrated sanitization capacity since the monitored pathogens were never found in the mature digestate over the entire duration of the monitoring survey. Furthermore, tests on the regrowth of Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli, artificially inoculated on mature digestate, were also conducted under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions with the aim to assess the effectiveness of mature digestate as microbial growth medium. Concentrations of Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli were drastically reduced after a short time of incubation under anaerobic process and the two microorganisms already resulted undetectable after 24-48 h, whereas, under aerobic conditions, two microorganisms' concentrations were stably high for longer than 10 days.

Interventions to alleviate these barriers are urgently needed. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the development of CuidaTEXT, a tailored SMS text messaging intervention to support Latinx family caregivers of individuals with dementia. METHODS: CuidaTEXT is informed by the stress process framework and social cognitive theory. We developed and refined CuidaTEXT using a mixed methods approach that included thematic analysis and descriptive statistics. We followed 6 user-centered design stages, namely, the selection of design principles, software vendor collaboration, evidence-based foundation, caregiver and research and clinical advisory board guidance, sketching and prototyping, and usability testing of the prototype of CuidaTEXT among 5 Latinx caregivers. RESULTS: CuidaTEXT is a bilingual 6-month-long SMS text messaging–based intervention tailored to caregiver needs that includes 1-3 daily automatic messages (n=244) about logistics, dementia education, self-care, social support, end of life, care of the person with dementia, behavioral symptoms, and problem-solving strategies; 783 keyword-driven text messages for further help with the aforementioned topics; live chat interaction with a coach for further help; and a 19-page reference booklet summarizing the purpose and functions of the intervention. The 5 Latinx caregivers who used the prototype of CuidaTEXT scored an average of 97 out of 100 on the System Usability Scale.

We examined how changes pediatric ED visits during the early months of the COVID19 pandemic differed by two markers of socio-economic disadvantage, minoritized race and being publicly insured. Methods: This retrospective observational study used electronic medical records from a large pediatric ED in a Deep South state for January-June 2020. Three time-periods -- pre-COVID19 (TP0), COVID19 with restrictions like stay-at-home (TP1), and COVID19 with restrictions relaxed (TP2) in 2020 were compared with the corresponding time-periods in 2019. Changes in overall visits, visits for minoritized race (MR) versus non-Hispanic white (NHW) children, and Medicaid-enrolled versus privately-insured children were considered, and changes in acuity-mix of ED visits and share of visits resulting in inpatient admits were inspected. Results: Compared to 2019, total ED visits declined in TP1 and TP2 of 2020 (54.3%, 48.9%). Declines were larger for MR children (57.3%, 57.8%) compared to NHW children (50.5%, 39.3%), and Medicaid enrollees (56.5%, 52.0%) compared to the privately insured (48.3%, 39.0%). Particularly, MR children saw steeper percentage declines in high-acuity visits and visits resulting in inpatient admissions compared to NHW children. The mix of pediatric patients by race and insurance-status, as well as the share of high-acuity visits and visits with inpatient admissions differed between TP1 and TP2 of 2019 and 2020 (p<0.05 for all cases). In contrast, there was little evidence of difference between TP0 of 2019 and 2020. Conclusion: The role of socioeconomic disadvantage and the potential impacts on pediatric ED visits during COVID19 in the Deep South of the United States changes is understudied. We find evidence of steeper declines in visits among MR and Medicaid-enrolled children, including for high-acuity conditions, than their NHW and privately-insured counterparts.

Proctological patients and surgeons are experiencing a previously unseen change in care with unknown repercussion. Here we discuss the proctological experience of 4 Italian hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Following remote brainstorming, the authors summarised their experience in managing proctological patients during the COVID-19 pandemics and put forward some practical observations to further investigate. RESULTS: The 4 hospitals shifted from a high-volume proctological activity to almost “zero” visits and surgery. Every patient accessing the hospital must respect a specific COVID-19 protocol. Proctological patients can be stratified based on presentation and management considerations into (1) neoplastic patients, the only allowed to be surgically treated, (2) the ones requiring urgent care, operated only in highly selected cases and (3) the stable, already known patients, managed remotely. Changes in the clinical management of the proctological disease are presented together with some considerations to be explored. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of scientific evidence, these practical considerations may be valuable to proctological surgeons starting to face the COVID-19 pandemics.

Various epigenetic mechanisms have been identified in the pathogenesis of human diseases. Here, we examined the effects of ten epigenetic agents on pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection by using GFP-reporter assays. Inhibitors of bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4), which receives much more attention in cancer than viral infection, was found to exhibit substantial anti-viral activity against PRV as well as a range of DNA and RNA viruses. We further demonstrated that BRD4 inhibition boosted a robust innate immune response. BRD4 inhibition also de-compacted chromatin structure and induced the DNA damage response, thereby triggering the activation of cGAS-mediated innate immunity and increasing host resistance to viral infection both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the inhibitory effect of BRD4 inhibition on viral infection was mainly attributed to the attenuation of viral attachment.

Specifically, we focused on the extent APT was a part of online teaching practices, what characterized teachers who tended to promote APT more in online, remote teaching, and associations between APT and teacher well-being, as well as student motivation and engagement. Findings from two survey studies (Study 1: 99 teachers, and 83 students; Study 2: 399 teachers) revealed the following patterns: Students and teachers agreed that APT was used to a lesser extent in remote, online classes, and associated with more interactive instructional formats (whole classroom discussion, peer group work, and questioning), but not with frontal teaching and individual task completion. Teachers with a higher sense of teaching self-efficacy, autonomous orientations, and higher empathy tended to promote APT in online, remote teaching more. More APT was associated with greater teachers’ work-related (i.e., lower burnout, more commitment to teaching, and lower turnover intentions) and psychological well-being (i.e., less depressive and anxiety symptoms, and higher subjective well-being).

In addition to being a target of the virus, the kidney also seems to have substantial influence on the outcomes of the disease. Methods: Data was obtained by a comprehensive and non-systematic search in the PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus and SciELO databases, using mainly the terms ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""COVID-19"", ""chronic kidney disease"", ""renal transplantation"", acute kidney injury"" and ""renal dysfunction"". Discussion: The membrane-bound angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and this interaction may lead to an imbalance of the Renin Angiotensin System (RAS), associated with worse clinical presentations of COVID-19, including acute pulmonary injury, hyperinflammatory state and hematological alterations. In the framework of renal diseases, development of acute kidney injury is associated mostly with immune alterations and direct cytopathic lesions by the virus, leading to higher mortality. As for chronic kidney disease, the patients at a non-terminal stage have worse prog-nosis, while the hemodialysis patients appear to have mild courses of COVID-19, probably due to lower chances of being affected by the cytokine storm. Furthermore, the current scenario is unfavorable to kidney donation and transplantation. The relationship between COVID-19 and immunosuppression in kidney transplantation recipients has been greatly discussed to determine whether it increases mortality and how it interacts with immunosuppressive medications.

DESIGN: Multicentre prospective observational study of mechanically ventilated ward patients. Modified Poisson regression was used to assess association between nurse to patient ratio (NPR) and 90-day mortality, adjusted for designated medical team, Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) triage priority and centre effect. NPR was divided into low (1:9.6 to 1:10), medium (1:6 to 1:8) and high (1:2.6). Sensitivity analysis was conducted for pneumonia with or without acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to assess magnitude of association. SETTING: 7 acute public hospitals in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: All 485 mechanically ventilated patients in wards from participating hospitals between 18 January 2016 and 17 April 2016 were recruited. Three hundred patients were included after excluding patients with limitation of therapy within 24 hours of intubation. MAIN OUTCOMES: 90-day mortality, Mortality Prediction Model III Standardised mortality ratio (MPMIII(0) SMR). RESULTS: 201 patients died within 90 days after intubation (67.0%, 95% CI 61.5% to 72.1%), with MPMIII(0) SMR 1.88, 95% CI 1.63 to 2.17.

The objective is to develop and validate an ultrasound training methodology oriented to the clinical practice of the family physician. METHODS Quasi-experimental study, with a before/after design, a control group, and 1 year of follow-up. Twenty family physicians working in primary care health centers with a list of over 800 patients will be included, as well as a control group of family physicians with similar characteristics in terms of age, sex, and patient list. A structured training process oriented to the clinical practice of the family physician, primary care clinical ultrasound classroom (AECAP), will be carried out, and the improvement of knowledge and skills of the participants will be evaluated, as well as the improvement of the quality of care based on clinical indicators. DISCUSSION The family physician is in a privileged situation allows increasing the performance of ultrasound in frequent clinical situations and reducing care hours. We hope that the results obtained in this study demonstrate the effectiveness of the structured training method (AECAP) and support the generalization of ultrasound in primary health care.

This case series addresses cognition in post-COVID-19 patient by describing three patients in acute rehabilitation to inform a model of cognitive sequelae of COVID-19. Methods: Three English-speaking inpatients with severe symptoms and long-term intensive care unit (ICU) treatment are described. All patients had a premorbid history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia and experienced delirium and hypoxemia when hospitalized. Patient 1 is a 62-year-old male with 15 years of education with additional history of obstructive sleep apnea and type 2 diabetes. Patient 2 is a 73-year-old female with 12 years of education with a premorbid medical history of alcohol use disorder and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Patient 3 is a 75-year-old male with 14 years of education. No patients had premorbid psychiatric histories. Results: The three patients demonstrated deficits on formal neuropsychological testing, particularly with encoding and verbal fluency. Memory measures improved with a more structured story memory task compared to a less-structured verbal list-learning task, suggesting executive dysfunction impacted learning. None of the patients demonstrated rapid forgetting of information. Two patients endorsed new depressive and/or anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: The results suggest evidence for neurocognitive deficits after severe COVID-19 infection, particularly in encoding and verbal fluency. These results were interpreted with caution given the limited number of patients and the telephone-based battery. The specific mechanism that caused these cognitive deficits in these individuals remains unclear.

Many medical and nursing schools do not adequately, if at all, teach how to manage children with SAM. There is a dearth of experienced practitioners and trainers to serve as exemplars of good practice or participate in capacity development. We consider 4 country studies of scaling up implementation of WHO guidelines for improving the inpatient management of SAM within under-resourced public sector health services in South Africa, Bolivia, Malawi, and Ghana. Drawing on implementation reports, qualitative and quantitative data from our research, prospective and retrospective data collection, self-reflection, and our shared experiences, we review our capacity-building approaches for improving quality of care, implementation effectiveness, and lessons learned. These country studies provide important evidence that improved inpatient management of SAM is scalable in routine health services and scalability is achievable within different contexts and health systems. Effectiveness in reducing inpatient SAM deaths appears to be retained at scale. The country studies show evidence of impact on mortality early in the implementation and scaling-up process. However, it took many years to build workforce capacity, establish monitoring and mentoring procedures, and institutionalize the guidelines within health systems. Key features for success included collaborations to build capacity and undertake operational research and advocacy for guideline adoption; specialist teams to mentor and build confidence and competency through supportive supervision; and political commitment and administrative policies for sustainability.

METHODS The climate survey targeted medical physicists who are full members of the AAPM and included demographic inquiries and questions intended to assess the working environmental climate in terms of a sense of belonging and inclusion, experiences of discrimination and harassment, and obstacles to participation within the AAPM. The survey invitation was sent to 5500 members. Responses were collected from 1385 members (response rate of 25%) between January and February 2021. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS Overall, the medical physics workplace climate was positive. However, some demographic and professional subgroups reported lower levels of agreement with positive characteristics of their workplace climates. Compared to men, women ranked lower 7/8 categories that characterized the workplace climate. Other subgroups that also ranked the workplace climate descriptors lower included individuals not originally from the US/Canada (3/8). Most respondents strongly agreed/agreed that the climate within the AAPM was welcoming. However, 17% of respondents reported personally experiencing or witnessing microaggressions within the AAPM. Overall, medical physicists reported low levels of agreement that opportunities within the AAPM were available to them, from 34-60% among eight categories, including opportunities to volunteer, join committees, and take leadership positions within the AAPM. Several subgroups reported even lower levels of agreement that these opportunities are available. Asian/Asian American respondents (3/8) and physicists with origins in countries outside the US/Canada (7/8) reported fewer opportunities to participate in the AAPM. Medical physicists reported their experiences of discrimination and sexual harassment in their workplaces and within the AAPM. For those who report personal experiences of sexual harassment, only 24% (15/63) feel comfortable reporting when it occurred within their workplaces, and 35% (9/26) feel comfortable reporting when it occurred within the AAPM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive KTRs diagnosed with COVID-19 at our center were evaluated for clinical presentation and outcome; duration of viral shedding and viral burden by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay cycle threshold; and magnitude of seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Six KTRs identified with COVID-19 were hospitalized. Presenting symptoms were similar to those in the general population. Four patients had severe disease and, of these, 2 required mechanical ventilation, 4 had acute kidney injury, and 3 had secondary bacterial infections. Immunosuppression was reduced in all patients. Five patients were treated with hydroxychloroquine. No patient required dialysis or died. Patients with severe disease had a longer duration of viral shedding, which lasted more than 40 days, and had IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, which were detected from 3 weeks to as long as 10 weeks after symptom onset. In patients with less severe disease no IgG antibodies where detected between 9 and 14 weeks after symptom onset.

During the coronavirus diseases 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, VAERS got more attention as its important role in monitoring the safety of the vaccines. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate VAERS patterns, reported AEFIs, adverse events of special interest (AESIs), impact of different pandemics since its inception, and surveillance rate of serious vs nonserious AEFIs. Methods: This was an observational study using VARES data from 2/7/1990 to 12/11/2021. Patterns of reports over years were first described, followed by a comparison of reports statistics per year. Furthermore, a comparison of incidents (death, ER visits, etc.) statistics over years, in addition to statistics of each vaccine were calculated. Moreover, each incident's statistics for each vaccine were calculated and top vaccines were reported. Finally, survival analysis utilizing cox regression was done, in addition to AESIs distribution stratified by age groups and gender. All analyses were conducted using R (Version 1.4.1717) and Excel for Microsoft 365. Results: There were 1,396,280 domestic and 346,210 non-domestic reports during 1990-2021, including 228 vaccines. For both domestic and non-domestic reports, year of 2021 had the highest reporting rate (48.52% and 70.33%), in addition a notable changes in AEFIs patterns were recorded during 1991, 1998, 2000, 2006, 2009, 2011, and 2017. AEFIs were as follow: deaths (1.00% and 4.08%), ER or doctor visits (13.37% and 2.27%), hospitalizations (5.84% and 27.78%), lethal threat (1.42% and 4.38%), and disabilities (1.4% and 7.96%). Pyrexia was the top reported symptom during the past 31 years, except for 2021 where headache was the top one. COVID-19 vaccines namely Moderna, Pfizer-Biontech, and Janssen were the top 3 reported vaccines with headache, pyrexia, and fatigue as the top associated AEFIs. Followed by Zoster, Seasonal Influenza, Pneumococcal, and Human papillomavirus vaccines. Myocarditis or Pericarditis were the top reported AESIs (26.95% and 25.84%). Male (HR:1.15, 1.14 - 1.16) for domestic (HR:1.23, 1.22 -1.25) for nondomestic have a higher probability of having serious AEFIs. In addition, age group [≤] 5 years old in domestic and >84 years old in nondomestic have a higher probability of having AEFIs compared to other age groups. Conclusions: The large data available in VARES make it a useful tool for detecting and monitoring vaccine AEFIs.

DESCRIPTION: COVID-19 directly affects pregnant women causing more severe disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The indirect effects due to the monumental COVID-19 response are much worse, increasing maternal and neonatal mortality. ASSESSMENT: Amidst COVID-19, governments must balance effective COVID-19 response measures while continuing delivery of essential health services. Using the World Health Organization’s operational guidelines as a base, countries must conduct contextualized analyses to tailor their operations. Evidence based information on different services and comparative cost-benefits will help decisions on trade-offs. Situational analyses identifying extent and reasons for service disruptions and estimates of impacts using modelling techniques will guide prioritization of services. Ensuring adequate supplies, maintaining core interventions, expanding non-physician workforce and deploying telehealth are some adaptive measures to optimize care. Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, governments must reinvest in maternal and child health by building more resilient maternal health services supported by political commitment and multisectoral engagement, and with assistance from international partners. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-sectoral investments providing high-quality care that ensures continuity and available to all segments of the population are needed. A robust primary healthcare system linked to specialist care and accessible to all segments of the population including marginalized subgroups is of paramount importance.

This paper aims to share key components and learnings of a community engagement process for an integrated ECD intervention. The lessons shared are drawn from a case study of urban informal settlement with embedded refugees in Nairobi, Kenya. METHODS: We conducted three stakeholder meetings with representatives from the Ministry of Health at County and Sub-County, actors in the ECD sector, and United Nations agency in refugee management, a transect walk across five villages (Ngando, Muslim, Congo, Riruta and Kivumbini); and, six debrief meetings by staff from the implementing organization. The specific steps and key activities undertaken, the challenges faced and benefits accrued from the community engagement process are highlighted drawing from the implementation team’s perspective. RESULTS: Context relevant, well-planned community engagement approaches can be integrated into the five broad components of stakeholder engagement, formative research, identification of local resources, integration into local lives, and shared control/leadership with the local community. These can yield meaningful stakeholder buy-in, community support and trust, which are crucial for enabling ECD programme sustainability.

Government reports documented Pb deposition immediately downwind of the cathedral and a twentyfold increase in airborne Pb concentrations at a distance of 50 km in the aftermath. For this study, we collected 100 samples of surface soil from tree pits, parks, and other sites in all directions within 1 km of the cathedral. Concentrations of Pb measured by X-ray fluorescence range from 30 to 9,000 mg/kg across the area, with a higher proportion of elevated concentrations to the northwest of the cathedral, in the direction of the wind prevailing during the fire. By integrating these observations with a Gaussian process regression model, we estimate that the average concentration of Pb in surface soil downwind of the cathedral is 430 (95% interval, 300-590) mg/kg, nearly double the average Pb concentration in the other directions of 240 (95% interval, 170-320) mg/kg. The difference corresponds to an integrated excess Pb inventory within a 1 km radius of 1.0 (95% interval, 0.5-1.5) t, about 0.2% of all the Pb covering the roof and spire. This is over 6 times the estimated amount of Pb deposited downwind 1-50 km from the cathedral.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey jointly developed by University College Dublin and Cystic Fibrosis Ireland (CFI) research teams was made available to complete using SmartSurvey UK. The survey was advertised widely by CFI via social media (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook), the CFI website and through CFI PWCF WhatsApp groups. Results: Approximately half (50.8%) of PWCF cocooned. Most participants spent their day while cocooning performing exercises, doing household chores, and watching TV. Most of the participants ordered groceries/medications online, whereas smaller numbers had them delivered by family or friends. Amongst the participants who worked (46.2%), 87.2% (n = 48) worked from home during the pandemic. More PWCF aged <35 years (9.6%) worked onsite as compared those 35 years or over (1.9%). 95% employers were sympathetic for the participants who cocooned while working from home. However, approximately one-third of the employers were considered unsympathetic to PWCF who were not working due to cocooning. Employers were equally sympathetic to females and males and to younger and older PWCF. Majority of participants had access to excellent quality of internet service during pandemic, but this differed by urban/rural divide. Conclusion: Some PWCF faced challenges in relation to work while cocooning due to the pandemic risk. While Ireland provided pandemic unemployment payment assistance to those who lost jobs, this did not fully compensate most people. The urban/rural difference noted reflects national broadband rollout delays.

The inflammasome has evolved for this purpose and is an important surveillance system that, when triggered, fights infection and eliminates pathogens. However, there is growing evidence that the inflammasome also plays a role in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic respiratory disease. Inflammasomes contribute to both the clearance of the pathogen as well as its pathogenesis – depending on the amount of inflammation triggered. How respiratory viruses trigger inflammasome activation remains unclear. Emerging evidence shows that ion flux is responsible for triggering inflammasome activation in the lung, causing lung pathology and disease exacerbations. Viroporins, encoded by all common respiratory viruses, are responsible for the changes in intracellular ion homeostasis that modulate inflammasome activation. This is a novel mechanism by which respiratory viral infection activates inflammasomes, and identifies sensing of disturbances in intracellular ionic concentrations as a novel pathogen-recognition pathway in the lung.",2014-06-29,"Triantafilou, Kathy; Triantafilou, Martha",Trends Microbiol,,document_parses/pdf_json/a5e73cc98dbb656a10b933669a53110be9b5d136.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24986075/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966842X14001206; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0966842X14001206; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2014.06.002,205401382.0,2014,152

Overall, data from three framing experiments (N = 1114) in Germany and the United States indicate limited evidence on the effectiveness of the tested militaristic metaphors. In the U.S. context, the non‐militaristic concept of struggle was consistently more strongly associated with the desired outcomes than militaristic metaphors were.

A congruency effect of the use of a narrative and of warfare metaphors was found in the German sample, but not in that of the United States. Results of post‐experimental norming studies (N = 437) in both countries revealed that the metaphor of war is associated with people ascribing greater responsibility to their governments, whereas the concept of struggle triggers a sense of individual responsibility.

METHODS: RPMVECs were isolated and the mRNA and protein levels of different toll-like receptors (TLR) were assessed by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The LPS-induced expressions of TLR4, TNF-α and iNOS were analyzed in RPMVECs treated with different concentrations of simvastatin for different times. NF-κB activation was examined by immuofluroscence, luciferase reporter assay and western blotting. RESULTS: TLR4 is abundantly expressed in RPMVECs, and its expression is induced by LPS stimulation. Simvastatin inhibited LPS-induced TLR4 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in a time-dependent manner (p<0.01), and alleviated inflammation in RPMVECs by inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors such as TNF-α and iNOS. Further study indicated that simvastatin significantly attenuated NF-κB activity by inhibiting the degradation of IκB-α. Pretreatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and knock-down of TLR4 expression by RNA interference down-regulated the LPS-induced inflammatory response in RPMVECs.

We aimed to describe the clinical and imaging features of COVID-19-associated ICH. METHODS: Multicenter, retrospective, case–control analysis comparing ICH in COVID-19 patients (COV19 +) versus controls without COVID-19 (COV19 −). Clinical presentation, laboratory markers, and severity of COVID-19 disease were recorded. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) markers (intrahematoma hypodensity, heterogeneous density, blend sign, irregular shape fluid level), ICH location, and hematoma volume (ABC/2 method) were analyzed. The outcome of interest was ultraearly hematoma growth (uHG) (defined as NCCT baseline ICH volume/onset-to-imaging time), whose predictors were explored with multivariable linear regression. RESULTS: A total of 33 COV19 + patients and 321 COV19 − controls with ICH were included. Demographic characteristics and vascular risk factors were similar in the two groups. Multifocal ICH and NCCT markers were significantly more common in the COV19 + population. uHG was significantly higher among COV19 + patients (median 6.2 mL/h vs 3.1 mL/h, p = 0.027), and this finding remained significant after adjustment for confounding factors (systolic blood pressure, antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy), in linear regression (B(SE) = 0.31 (0.11), p = 0.005). This association remained consistent also after the exclusion of patients under anticoagulant treatment (B(SE) = 0.29 (0.13), p = 0.026).

The study aims to analyse the products' antioxidative activities, chemical and sensory properties, as well as the probiotic survivability in the dry matrices. The basic chemical composition showed that 100 g of product can fulfil up to 4.4% and 3.3% of the daily iron value from chickpeas and green lentils, respectively (assuming the iron bioavailability is 23%). Sensory evaluation and hedonic analysis of the fresh pulse snack bar showed that panelists preferred the chickpea snack bar over the green lentil snack bar. For storage analysis, snack bars were stored at 20 °C and were vacuum packaged in sealed low density polyethylene (LDPE) pouches with no light exposure for two months. Hedonic analysis during storage showed significant differences in the aroma of the snack bars (p < 0.05). Generally, the antioxidant activities decreased during the two months of storage.

System Dynamics is a well-established computer-based simulation modeling methodology for analyzing complex social systems that are difficult to change and predict. This approach has been applied for decades to a wide variety of issues of healthcare and other types of service capacity and delivery, and more recently, to some issues of disaster planning and mitigation. The study will use the System Dynamics approach to create computer simulation models as “what-if” tools for disaster preparedness planners. We have recently applied the approach to the issue of hospital surge capacity, and have reached some preliminary conclusions – for example, on the question of where in the hospital to place supplementary nursing staff during a severe infectious disease outbreak—some of which we had not expected. Other hospital disaster preparedness issues well suited to System Dynamics analysis include sustaining employee competence and reducing turnover, coordination of medical care and public health resources, and hospital coordination with the wider community to address mass casualties. The approach may also be applied to preparedness issues for agencies other than hospitals, and could help to improve the interactions among all agencies represented in a community's local emergency planning committee. The simulation models will support an evidence-based approach to rural disaster planning, helping to tie empirical data to decision-making. Disaster planners will be able to simulate a wide variety of scenarios, learn responses to each and develop principles or best practices that apply to a broad spectrum of disaster scenarios.

There is good evidence that vitamin D deficiency contributes to the seasonal increase of virus infections of the respiratory tract, from the common cold to influenza, and now possibly also COVID-19. This communication explores key factors that make it more likely, particularly in combination, that individuals are vitamin D deficient. These factors include old age, obesity, dark skin tone and common genetic variants that impede vitamin D status. Precision nutrition is an approach that aims to consider known personal risk factors and health circumstances to provide more effective nutrition guidance in health and disease. In regard to avoiding vitamin D deficiency, people with excess body fat, a dark skin tone or older age usually need to use a moderately dosed daily vitamin D supplement, particularly those living in a high-latitude region, getting little ultraviolet B exposure due to air pollution or staying mostly indoors. Carriers of the GC (group-specific component) rs4588 AA genotype also are more likely to become deficient. Very high-dosed supplements with more than 4000 IU vitamin D are rarely needed or justified. A state-by-state Mendelian randomisation analysis of excess COVID-19 mortality of African-Americans in the USA shows a greater disparity in northern states than in southern states. It is conceivable that vitamin D adequacy denies the virus easy footholds and thereby slows spreading of the contagion. This finding should drive home the message that vitamin D supplementation is particularly important for individuals with dark skin tones. Vitamin D deficiency, even for a few months during the winter and spring season, must be rigorously remedied because of its many adverse health impacts that include decreased life expectancy and increased mortality.

The causes of coagulopathy are poorly understood. Aim: To investigate the relationship between von Willebrand factor (VWF) biomarkers, intravascular hemolysis, coagulation, and organ damage in COVID19 patients and to study their association with disease severity and mortality. Methods: 181 hospitalized adult COVID19 patients were randomly selected with a balanced distribution of survivors and non-survivors during the period of March 26(th) 2020 to May 5(th) 2020. The medical records and laboratory values were reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed using R studio V.3.6.2. Results: Patients who died (n=90) had significantly lower ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity, elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels, increased schistocyte/RBC fragment counts, and elevated VWF antigen and activity levels compared to patients discharged alive (n=91). In 31 patients, we measured several of these biomarkers on two or more occasions. The trending of ADAMTS13 activity illustrated that it is not steady throughout the hospitalization course. ADAMTS13 activity levels tended to improve and/or reach normal levels in patients that survived, yet ADAMTS13 activity levels worsened in most patients that died. Likewise, the VWF antigen and activity levels tended to decrease in patients that survived whereas tended to increase well above the normal range (2-3 folds) in patients that died. D-Dimer levels trended downwards in survivors, sometimes to levels less than 1 µg/ml, yet tended to increase in patients who died. Given the relationship between ADAMTS13 activity and mortality, we wanted to determine a cut-point of initial ADAMTS13 activity (within 72 hours from admission) to predict mortality. 102 patients in our cohort had an ADAMTS13 activity measurement within this timeframe. We determined that this optimal cut-point of initial ADAMTS13 activity was 43% using Youden’s J statistic. Only 30% of patients who had an ADAMTS13 activity level of less than 43% on admission survived, yet 60% of patients survived who had an ADAMTS13 activity level of greater than 43% on admission. Conclusions: COVID-19 may present with low ADAMTS13 activity in a subset of hospitalized patients. Presence of schistocytes/RBC fragment and elevated D-dimer levels on admission may warrant a work-up for ADAMTS13 activity and VWF antigen and activity levels.

METHODS: A retrospective study of children (< 19 years) with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital who underwent CT of the chest and/or abdomen was conducted. Data compiled from electronic medical records included demographics, body mass index (BMI), length of stay, ICU admission, invasive mechanical ventilation and death. Waist circumference and perimeters for skeletal muscle mass (abdominal, psoas and paraspinal muscles) were measured on an axial CT image at the level of the twelfth thoracic vertebra or first lumbar vertebra using FIJI software. RESULTS: Fifty-seven subjects were identified (54% male, median age 15.6 years, 61% Hispanic, 23% African-American). 25% (14/57) were admitted to the ICU and 21% (12/57) needed intubation. 9% (5/57) died. Waist circumference ranged between 53.2 and 138.4 cm (mean 86.58 ± 18.74 cm) and skeletal muscle mass ranged between 0.6 and 6.8 cm(2) (mean 3.5 ± 1.19 cm(2)). Lower skeletal muscle mass had a univariate association with ICU admission (odds ratio (OR) 0.4; 95%CI 0.17–0.76; p = 0.01) and mortality (OR 0.22; 95%CI 0.04–0.69; p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed similar association after controlling for comorbidities (adjusted OR 0.46; 95%CI 0.19–0.95; p = 0.04 and adjusted OR 0.31; 95%CI 0.06–0.95; p = 0.04, respectively). There was no association between BMI or waist circumference with ICU stay, mechanical ventilation or mortality.

Alcohol brief interventions (ABIs) combine an assessment of a person’s alcohol use with advice to reduce health risks. Despite their effectiveness, ABIs are not routinely performed by clinicians. This article presents a protocol for a feasibility trial of pragmatic implementation strategies and a new set of resources to support clinicians to complete ABIs in Australian general practices. AIM: To explore the facilitators and barriers to increasing the uptake of ABIs in primary care, including acceptability, reach, adoption, fidelity, and sustainability. DESIGN & SETTING: A mixed-methods evaluation of the uptake of ABIs in general practice clinics serving low-income communities in Melbourne, Australia. The approach is informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Normalisation Process Theory (NPT). METHOD: The implementation strategies and resources will be trialled in five general practices over 12 months. The primary outcome will be change in the proportion of adult patients with a complete alcohol history in their electronic medical records. Baseline data collection includes a practice survey to describe practice routines for ABIs and de-identified patient medical record data on completed alcohol histories (repeated at 3, 6, 9, and 12-months post-intervention). Survey and interview data will also be collected from clinicians, patients, and primary health network staff to assess acceptability and feasibility of the intervention.

However, compared to cigarettes, regulation of waterpipe product smoking lags behind and presents unique challenges. In search for regulatory options, this systematic review analyzes 36 studies on the differential effects on human health of the waterpipe characteristics including smoking products, heating sources, device components, and packages. METHODS: A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines, revealing 443 unique citations. After screening, 36 studies were included in the results. Research articles were selected to inform on differential effects caused by product characteristics on adverse health effects, attractiveness, addictiveness and prevalence of waterpipe use. RESULTS: Flavors are the key aspect that defines attractiveness of waterpipe product smoking. All waterpipe products, with or without nicotine, produce toxicants in similar quantities as cigarettes. Heating sources for waterpipe tobacco include charcoals and electrical heating. Both heating sources increase toxicant emissions in different ways. Hoses and mouth tips are device components that are often shared in waterpipe smoking. Sharing influences attractiveness by enriching the social experience. At the same time, it influences the transfer of infectious diseases by bacteria and viruses from one smoker to another. Studies showed that more generic and less attractive packages with health warnings are effective in reducing the attractiveness of waterpipe smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we advise to include all waterpipe products, tobacco and non-tobacco, with or without nicotine, in tobacco product regulations and smoking bans in order to: ban waterpipe molasses with characterizing flavors or ban the use of flavorings at any level; mandate dissemination of information on all waterpipe tobacco elements to the national regulator; prescribe testing to regulate contents of waterpipe smoking products and heating sources. Moreover, we advise to stimulate research on emissions of waterpipes.",2020-08-25,"Kienhuis, Anne S.; Talhout, Reinskje",Tob Induc Dis,,document_parses/pdf_json/63825eef10b4249e1d501f4d70f8e6362d609e01.json,https://doi.org/10.18332/tid/125079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32934615/,221350743.0,2020,297

The corresponding apps track individuals and their interactions, to facilitate alerting users of potential infections well before they become infectious themselves. Naive implementation obviously jeopardizes the privacy of health conditions, location, activities, and social interaction of its users. A number of protocol designs for colocation tracking have already been developed, most of which claim to function in a privacy preserving manner. However, despite claims such as""GDPR compliance"",""anonymity"",""pseudonymity""or other forms of""privacy"", the authors of these designs usually neglect to precisely define what they (aim to) protect. We make a first step towards formally defining the privacy notions of proximity tracing services, especially with regards to the health, (co-)location, and social interaction of their users.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center collaborated with international and local experts to hold a cervical cancer prevention course in Nepal in November 2019. The course included didactic lectures and a hands-on workshop. The didactic lectures included the epidemiology of cervical cancer globally and locally, cervical cancer screening guidelines, human papillomavirus vaccination, colposcopy and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), cervical dysplasia, and cervical cancer treatment.

The model incorporates the spread of awareness among individuals and, moreover, a small inflow of imported cases. These cases prevent stochastic extinctions when we simulate the epidemics and, hence, they allow to check whether the average dynamics for the fraction of infected individuals are accurately predicted by the ODE model. Stochastic simulations confirm the existence of sustained oscillations for different types of random networks, with a sharp transition from a non-oscillatory asymptotic regime to a periodic one as the alerting rate of susceptible individuals increases from very small values. This abrupt transition to periodic epidemics of high amplitude is quite accurately predicted by the Hopf-bifurcation curve computed from the ODE model using the alerting rate and the infection transmission rate for aware individuals as tuning parameters.",2020-07-31,"Juher, David; Rojas, David; Saldana, Joan",,,document_parses/pdf_json/57b35c0c9e74ced210b36ec4ba68f145cccd1e12.json,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15938v1.pdf,220920017.0,2020,147

Furthermore, it has been shown that accrual to cancer trials dropped substantially in 2020. Building on findings from a previous pilot survey, the present study used qualitative methods to gain insights into attitudes towards participation in research studies amongst people who have experienced cancer, in the context of the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: We interviewed 13 participants from the UK, who were purposively sampled, including a broad sample of cancer types, and a mixture of individuals who have and have not taken part in research previously. Participants underwent semi-structured interviews (median interview duration: 47 min) and were asked open-ended questions about their attitude towards and experiences with COVID-19, and their attitude towards research participation. In addition to this, prompts were used to ask participants about concerns that were highlighted by our previous quantitative work on this topic, such as concerns about being older or having to travel to participate. Interview transcripts were analysed using a framework analysis approach. Results: Our findings suggest that cancer patient decision-making about research participation during an infectious disease pandemic may be a function of a basic cost-benefit analysis, which considers the benefit of taking part, either personally to themselves or to wider society. The benefit may then be weighed by the patient against the risk of being infected, which may be influenced by trust in the relevant clinicians/researchers; familiarity with the study location; provision of detailed information on safety protocols for infectious disease; and, in particular, the availability of safe transport to and from the study location. Discussion: Some cancer patients say that they would be less likely to participate in a research study in the middle of an infectious disease pandemic due to an increased risk to themselves. Patients' perceived risk to themselves from participating may be ameliorated via the provision of certain practical solutions that can be considered at the study protocol design stage, such as safe travel, information, and the use of staff and study sites familiar to the patient.",2021-10-29,"Fox, Louis; Wylie, Harriet; Haire, Anna; Green, Saran; Kibaru, Joyce; Van Hemelrijck, Mieke",Front Public Health,,document_parses/pdf_json/19d92794164f5e3cd507c56ecf558860fcc056f3.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.741188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34778175/,240075920.0,2021,349

OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB and all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension and hospitalized due to COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective, multi-center study included 1128 adult patients with hypertension diagnosed with COVID-19, including 188 taking ACEI/ARB (ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [interquartile range, 55–68] years; 53.2% men) and 940 without using ACEI/ARB (non-ACEI/ARB group; median age 64 [interquartile range 57–69]; 53.5% men), who were admitted to 9 hospitals in Hubei Province, China from December 31, 2019 to February 20, 2020. In mixed-effect Cox model treating site as a random effect, after adjusting for age, gender, comorbidities, and in-hospital medications, the detected risk for all-cause mortality was lower in the ACEI/ARB group versus the non-ACEI/ARB group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.19–0.92]; P=0.03). In a propensity score-matched analysis followed by adjusting imbalanced variables in mixed-effect Cox model, the results consistently demonstrated lower risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients who received ACEI/ARB versus those who did not receive ACEI/ARB (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.37 [95% CI, 0.15–0.89]; P=0.03). Further subgroup propensity score-matched analysis indicated that, compared with use of other antihypertensive drugs, ACEI/ARB was also associated with decreased mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.12–0.70]; P=0.01) in patients with COVID-19 and coexisting hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and coexisting hypertension, inpatient use of ACEI/ARB was associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with ACEI/ARB nonusers. While study interpretation needs to consider the potential for residual confounders, it is unlikely that in-hospital use of ACEI/ARB was associated with an increased mortality risk.",2020-06-05,"Zhang, Peng; Zhu, Lihua; Cai, Jingjing; Lei, Fang; Qin, Juan-Juan; Xie, Jing; Liu, Ye-Mao; Zhao, Yan-Ci; Huang, Xuewei; Lin, Lijin; Xia, Meng; Chen, Ming-Ming; Cheng, Xu; Zhang, Xiao; Guo, Deliang; Peng, Yuanyuan; Ji, Yan-Xiao; Chen, Jing; She, Zhi-Gang; Wang, Yibin; Xu, Qingbo; Tan, Renfu; Wang, Haitao; Lin, Jun; Luo, Pengcheng; Fu, Shouzhi; Cai, Hongbin; Ye, Ping; Xiao, Bing; Mao, Weiming; Liu, Liming; Yan, Youqin; Liu, Mingyu; Chen, Manhua; Zhang, Xiao-Jing; Wang, Xinghuan; Touyz, Rhian M.; Xia, Jiahong; Zhang, Bing-Hong; Huang, Xiaodong; Yuan, Yufeng; Rohit, Loomba; Liu, Peter P.; Li, Hongliang",Circ Res,,document_parses/pdf_json/9e1fcf6d3c31f0f3b3b3fecc0422682069a92ba2.json,https://doi.org/10.1161/circresaha.120.317134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32302265/,215809826.0,2020,287

The aim of this pilot study was to explore the impact of the public health emergency due to COVID-19 on individual's mental health among 299 Italian adults after a month of home isolation due to COVID-19. DESIGN Cross-sectional study design. Adults of the general population were invited to a voluntary online health survey. METHODS Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to examine diverse psycho-social and stressful contextual factors associated with symptoms of psychopathology. RESULTS Results indicated that females reported higher symptoms of depression, anxiety and circadian rhythm dysregulation, than males. Age and the capacity to adapt to a new environment and to cope with illness were negatively associated with all symptoms of psychopathology. Conversely, engaging in verbally aggressive behaviours and having experienced stressful events related to COVID-19 were positively related to psychopathological symptoms. Finally, social support was negatively associated with depressive symptoms, and substance use during the past months was related to circadian rhythm dysregulation. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study raise particular concern about psychological well-being considering the negative associations between stressful events during the COVID-19 pandemic, symptoms of psychological distress, and perceived social support.

Cholera alone is estimated to cause 95,000 deaths per year, most of which occur in endemic settings with inadequate water access. Whilst a global strategy to eliminate cholera by 2030 calls for investment in improved drinking water services, there is limited rigorous evidence for the impact of improved water supply on endemic cholera transmission in low-income urban settings. Our protocol is designed to deliver a pragmatic health impact evaluation of a large-scale water supply intervention in Uvira (Democratic Republic of the Congo), a cholera transmission hotspot. METHODS/DESIGN: A stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial (SW-CRT) was designed to evaluate the impact of a large-scale drinking water supply intervention on cholera incidence among the 280,000 inhabitants of Uvira. The city was divided into 16 clusters, where new community and household taps will be installed following a randomised sequence over a transition period of up to 8 weeks in each cluster. The primary trial outcomes are the monthly incidence of “confirmed” cholera cases (patients testing positive by rapid detection kit) and of “suspected” cholera cases (patients admitted to the cholera treatment centre). Concurrent process and economic evaluations will provide further information on the context, costs, and efficiency of the intervention. DISCUSSION: In this protocol, we describe a pragmatic approach to conducting rigorous research to assess the impacts of a complex water supply intervention on severe diarrhoeal disease and cholera in an unstable, low-resource setting representative of cholera-affected areas. In particular, we discuss a series of pre-identified risks and linked mitigation strategies as well as the value of combining different data collection methods and preparation of multiple analysis scenarios to account for possible deviations from the protocol. The study described here has the potential to provide robust evidence to support more effective cholera control in challenging, high-burden settings.

Early in the pandemic many locations had limited testing and reporting, so that standard methods for determining IFR and CFR required large adjustments for missed cases. We present an alternate approach, based on results from the countries at the time that had a high test to positive case ratio to estimate symptomatic CFR. METHODS: We calculated age specific (0–69, 70–79, 80+ years old) time corrected crude symptomatic CFR values from 7 countries using two independent time to fatality correction methods. Data was obtained through May 7, 2020. We applied linear regression to determine whether the mean of these coefficients had converged to the true symptomatic CFR values. We then tested these coefficients against values derived in later studies as well as a large random serological study in NYC at that time. RESULTS: The age dependent symptomatic CFR values accurately predicted the percentage of the population infected as reported by two random testing studies in NYC. They also were in good agreement with later studies that estimated age specific IFR and CFR values from serological studies and more extensive data sets available later in the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We found that for regions with extensive testing it is possible to get early accurate symptomatic CFR coefficients. These values, in combination with an estimate of the age dependence of infection, allows symptomatic CFR values and percentage of the population that is infected to be determined in similar regions with limited testing.",2021-08-18,"Rothman, Jessica E.; Eidelberg, David; Rothman, Samantha L.; Holford, Theodore R.; Rothman, Douglas L.",PLoS One,,document_parses/pdf_json/c6eddd7628ffac2e05b8f215dafe60d469cb5c83.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d9ef48dde85af6ca8c8b0f98b2bb0bb958019543.json,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407073/,237214096.0,2021,261

Because of limited prophylaxis and treatment options, new medical countermeasures are needed for these viruses classified by the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) as top priority biodefense Category A pathogens. Recombinant consensus interferon alpha (cIFN-α) is a licensed protein with broad clinical appeal. However, while cIFN-α has great therapeutic value, its utility for biodefense applications is hindered by its short in vivo half-life, mode and frequency of administration, and costly production. To address these limitations, we describe the use of DEF201, a replication-deficient adenovirus vector that drives the expression of cIFN-α, for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis of acute arenaviral infection modeled in hamsters. Intranasal administration of DEF201 24 h prior to challenge with Pichindé virus (PICV) was highly effective at protecting animals from mortality and preventing viral replication and liver-associated disease. A significant protective effect was still observed with a single dosing of DEF201 given two weeks prior to PICV challenge. DEF201 was also efficacious when administered as a treatment 24 to 48 h post-virus exposure. The protective effect of DEF201 was largely attributed to the expression of cIFN-α, as dosing with a control empty vector adenovirus did not protect hamsters from lethal PICV challenge. Effective countermeasures that are highly stable, easily administered, and elicit long lasting protective immunity are much needed for arena and other viral infections. The DEF201 technology has the potential to address all of these issues and may serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral to enhance host defense against a number of viral pathogens.",2011-10-24,"Gowen, Brian B.; Ennis, Jane; Russell, Andrew; Sefing, Eric J.; Wong, Min-Hui; Turner, Jeffrey",PLoS One,,document_parses/pdf_json/c1df508d29e27cafd7a54a39bc2e087caa3a6bc6.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3200317/,,2011,269

Better targeting surveillance and laboratory experiments to validate zoonotic potential requires predicting high-risk host species. A major bottleneck to this effort is the few species with available sequences for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, a key receptor required for viral cell entry. We overcome this bottleneck by combining species' ecological and biological traits with three-dimensional modelling of host-virus protein–protein interactions using machine learning. This approach enables predictions about the zoonotic capacity of SARS-CoV-2 for greater than 5000 mammals—an order of magnitude more species than previously possible. Our predictions are strongly corroborated by in vivo studies. The predicted zoonotic capacity and proximity to humans suggest enhanced transmission risk from several common mammals, and priority areas of geographic overlap between these species and global COVID-19 hotspots. With molecular data available for only a small fraction of potential animal hosts, linking data across biological scales offers a conceptual advance that may expand our predictive modelling capacity for zoonotic viruses with similarly unknown host ranges.",2021-11-24,"Fischhoff, Ilya R.; Castellanos, Adrian A.; Rodrigues, João P.

Affiliated medical school changes included: changing “live” to virtual lectures; canceling medical student GI electives; exempting medical students from treating COVID-19-infected patients; and graduating medical students on time despite partly missing clinical electives. Division was reorganized by changing “live” GI lectures to virtual lectures; four GI fellows temporarily reassigned as medical attendings supervising COVID-19-infected patients; temporarily mandated intubation of COVID-19-infected patients for esophagogastroduodenoscopy; postponing elective GI endoscopies; and reducing average number of endoscopies from 100 to 4 per weekday during pandemic peak! GI clinic visits reduced by half (postponing non-urgent visits), and physical visits replaced by virtual visits. Economic pandemic impact included temporary, hospital deficit subsequently relieved by federal grants; hospital employee terminations/furloughs; and severe temporary decline in GI practitioner’s income during surge. Hospital temporarily enhanced security and gradually ameliorated facemask shortage. GI program director contacted GI fellows twice weekly to ameliorate pandemic-induced stress. Divisional parties held virtually. GI fellowship applicants interviewed virtually. Graduate medical education changes included weekly committee meetings to monitor pandemic-induced changes; program managers working from home; canceling ACGME annual fellowship survey, changing ACGME physical to virtual site visits; and changing national conventions from physical to virtual.

METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent PCI in England between January 2017 and April 2020 in the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society-National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcomes Research database. Analysis was restricted to 44 hospitals that reported contemporaneous activity on PCI. Only patients with primary PCI for STEMI were included in the analysis. RESULTS A total of 34 127 patients with STEMI (primary PCI 33 938, facilitated PCI 108, rescue PCI 81) were included in the study. There was a decline in the number of procedures by 43% (n=497) in April 2020 compared with the average monthly procedures between 2017 and 2019 (n=865). For all patients, the median time from symptom to hospital showed increased after the lockdown (150 (99-270) vs 135 (89-250) min, p=0.004) and a longer door-to-balloon time after the lockdown (48 (21-112) vs 37 (16-94) min, p<0.001).

It helps in identifying domains requiring improvements to provide high quality pharmacy services to ensure the provision of enhanced pharmaceutical care. The current study aims to ascertain the extent of satisfaction towards pharmacy services among patients attending outpatient pharmacies in Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A hospital-based cross-sectional study involving 746 patients attending outpatient pharmacies of various public hospitals was conducted from 01 January to 15 February 2020. Information on socio-demographic profile of the study subjects along with their satisfaction towards outpatient pharmacy was extracted by using a 23-items questionnaire. These questions were divided into two domains including 7 questions related to the pharmacy facilities (questions from 1F to 7F) and 8 questions for pharmacy services (questions from 1S to 8S), where F and S denotes facilities and services, respectively. The cumulative satisfaction score was estimated by a 5-item Likert scale with a maximum score of 5 for each item. The relationship between demographics and satisfaction scores was evaluated by using appropriate statistics. RESULTS: There were 746 patients with male preponderance (58.8%). The overall satisfaction score was 2.97 ± 0.65. Satisfaction towards pharmacy services scored lower (mean score: 3.91 ± 0.77) than pharmacy facilities (mean score: 4.03 ± 0.66). Items related to patient`s counseling (3F, 2S, 3S, 6S) scored least during the analysis. Older patients (p = 0.006), male gender (p<0.001), Saudi nationality (0.035), patients attending primary care centers (p = 0.02), and patients with chronic illnesses were significantly associated with lower satisfaction score. CONCLUSION: This study reported that the satisfaction level of patients attending outpatient pharmacies was low and differed among various socio-demographic groups. Approximately one-half of the patients were not satisfied with outpatient pharmacy services.

METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of MT compared with standard care over a 5-year time horizon. Patients with ischemic stroke eligible for MT were identified from 2017 country-specific incidence data. A societal perspective was adopted, including health, social, and informal care costs, and productivity losses. Model outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted life years. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of findings. RESULTS: We identified 267 514 ischemic stroke cases that were eligible for MT treatment across 32 European countries. MT was found to be more effective and cheaper than standard care in two-thirds of the countries (21/32) and cost-effective in all but one country (Bulgaria). Across Europe, the intervention was estimated to produce over 101 327 additional quality-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty interval, 65 180–149 085) and cost savings of $981 million (€868 million, 95% uncertainty interval, −1544 to 2564) and of $1.7 billion (€1.5 billion, 95% uncertainty interval, −1.2 to 3.6) in health and social care and societal costs, respectively.

Therefore, identifying parental burnout protection factors is essential. This study aimed to assess the protective role of the following factors which can be increased through mindfulness practice: trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and concrete vs. abstract ruminations. A total of 459 parents (M(age) = 40; 98.7% female) completed self-reported questionnaires at two-time points to assess the predictive role of mindfulness on parental burnout, self-compassion and rumination type, and the mediating role of self-compassion and rumination type in the relation between mindfulness and parental burnout. Results showed that trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and rumination type at Time 1 predicted levels of parental burnout at Time 2. Self-compassion (indirect effects: b = − 22, 95% CI = [−38, −05], p < 0.01), concrete ruminations (indirect effects: b = −20, 95% CI = [−32, −09], p < 0.001), and abstract ruminations (indirect effects: b = −0.54, 95% CI = [−71, −37], p < 0.001) partially mediated the relation between trait-mindfulness and parental burnout. These findings showed that trait mindfulness, self-compassion, and concrete (vs. abstract) ruminations may help prevent parental burnout in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, ED debriefing remains infrequent and nonstandardized. A clinical tool (DISCERN-Debriefing In Situ Conversation after Emergent Resuscitation Now) was developed to facilitate ED debriefing. To date, there are no studies providing qualitative analysis of clinical event debriefs done using such a tool. Our goal was to explore common themes elicited by debriefing following implementation of DISCERN. Methods This was a retrospective mixed-methods study analyzing DISCERN data from 2012 through 2017 in a pediatric ED. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. With constant comparison analysis, themes were categorized when applicable within the context of crisis resource management (CRM) principles, previously used as a framework for description of nontechnical skills. Member checking was performed to ensure trustworthiness. Results We reviewed 400 DISCERN forms. Overall, 170 (41.6%) of target clinical events were debriefed during the study period. The number of clinical events debriefed per year decreased significantly over the study period, from 118 debriefed events in 2013 to 20 debriefed events in 2017 (p < 0.001). Events were more likely to be debriefed if cardiopulmonary resuscitation was needed (odds ratio [OR] = 11.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.1-33.8]) or if the patient expired (OR = 8.9, 95% CI = 2.7-29.1]). CRM principles accounted for 81% of debriefing statements, focusing on teamwork, communication, and preparation, and these themes remained consistent throughout the study period. Conclusions Use of the DISCERN tool declined over the study period. The DISCERN tool was utilized more commonly after the highest-acuity events. Clinical event debriefs aligned with CRM principles, with medical knowledge discussed less frequently, and the content of debriefs remained stable over time.",2021-08-01,"Chu, Jamie; Alawa, Nawara; Sampayo, Esther M; Doughty, Cara; Camp, Elizabeth; Welch-Horan, T Bram",AEM education and training,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10709; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34901688/,240415936.0,2021,283

Several machine-learning prognostic models for COVID-19 are currently available. However, external validation of these models has rarely been performed. Therefore, most reported predictive performance is optimistic and has a high risk of bias. This study aimed to develop and validate a model that predicts oxygen therapy needs in the early stages of COVID-19 using a sizable multicenter dataset. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included consecutive COVID-19 hospitalized patients confirmed by a reverse transcription chain reaction in 11 medical institutions in Fukui, Japan. We developed and validated seven machine-learning models (e.g., penalized logistic regression model) using routinely collected data (e.g., demographics, simple blood test). The primary outcome was the need for oxygen therapy (≥1 L/min or SpO(2) ≤ 94%) during hospitalization. C-statistics, calibration slope, and association measures (e.g., sensitivity) evaluated the performance of the model using the test set (randomly selected 20% of data for internal validation). Among these seven models, the machine-learning model that showed the best performance was re-evaluated using an external dataset. We compared the model performances using the A-DROP criteria (modified version of CURB-65) as a conventional method. RESULTS: Of the 396 patients with COVID-19 for the model development, 102 patients (26%) required oxygen therapy during hospitalization. For internal validation, machine-learning models, except for the k-point nearest neighbor, had a higher discrimination ability than the A-DORP criteria (P < 0.01). The XGboost had the highest c-statistic in the internal validation (0.92 vs. 0.69 in A-DROP criteria; P < 0.001). For the external validation with 728 temporal independent datasets (106 patients [15%] required oxygen therapy), the XG boost model had a higher c-statistic (0.88 vs. 0.69 in A-DROP criteria; P < 0.001).

Beyond the modeling of the overall COVID-19 outbreak, the pandemic has also motivated research assessing various policy decisions and event outcomes. One such area of study, addressed here, relates to the formulation of methods which measure the impact that large events or gatherings of people had in the local areas where the events were held. We formulate an alternative approach to traditional causal inference methods and then apply our method to assessing the impact that then President Donald Trump's re-election campaign rallies had on COVID-19 infections in areas where the rallies were hosted.

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting and Participants Electronic medical records for 152,225 chronic wounds from a network of 488 wound care clinics in 45 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. Methods Wound and patient characteristics, the number of chronic wounds newly seen at the clinics, and 12-week healing rates were compared between the first two quarters of 2019 and 2020. Multivariable regression models were constructed to evaluate whether the pandemic was associated with a statistically significant change in the probability of 12-week wound healing after risk adjustment. Results During the pandemic, wound and patient characteristics did not change compared to the previous year. Case volume dropped as much as 40% in April 2020 but returned to the previous year’s level by June. No systematic changes in measures of care continuity were observed. Unadjusted 12-week healing rates remained stable at 0.502 in 2019 and 0.503 in 2020. Likewise, risk-adjusted 12-week healing rates were 0.504 and 0.505 in 2019 and 2020, respectively, but the difference was not statistically significant. States with stricter lockdowns saw a greater decline in case volume. However, the pandemic was not associated with a statistically significant change in the probability of 12-week wound healing in most states. The percent of wounds with one or more telehealth visits increased from 0.14% in 2019 to 1.04% in 2020. Conclusions and Implications Despite COVID-19 related disruptions, our results suggest that wound care clinics maintained standards of care and outcomes for patients who sought care.

The varied natural ecologies of reptiles have the potential to impact how they perceive different stimuli, including zoo visitors. The current study aimed to explore the impact of visitors through observations on small groups of six reptile species during a temporary zoo closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic by measuring behavioral diversity, use of enclosure space, and select behaviors. The majority of the species showed intermediate responses to the change in visitor presence that varied in valence; however, some responses were more pronounced. ABSTRACT: Although reptiles are commonly housed in zoos and aquariums, their welfare is understudied for the diversity of species housed and the taxon’s current captive population size. The sensory abilities of reptiles have adapted to the varied ecological niches they inhabit, and these evolutionary adaptations impact how reptiles perceive the stimuli around them—including zoo visitors. This study aimed to assess visitor effects on small groups of six reptile species during a temporary zoo closure due to COVID-19 by measuring behavioral diversity, use of space (measured by a spread of participation index), and select behaviors. The species assessed showed diverse responses. The Catalina Island rattlesnakes (Crotalus catalinensis) demonstrated increased investigation and behavioral diversity after the zoo reopened compared to when the zoo was closed, but the European glass lizards (Pseudopus apodus) showed decreases in the amount of time spent exposed to the observers’ view and in their evenness of space use after the zoo was reopened to visitors. The other species, including beaded lizards (Heloderma horridum), Sonoran spiny-tailed iguana (Ctenosaura macrolopha), Arrau turtles (Podocnemis expansa), and dwarf caimans (Paleosuchus palpebrosus), had intermediate changes in their responses to visitor presence.",2022-04-15,"Hamilton, Jennifer; Gartland, Kylen N.; Jones, Megan; Fuller, Grace",Animals (Basel),,document_parses/pdf_json/f4536431a9b60536aa863f8b0895e5942e310fd3.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35454280/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani12081034,248221083.0,2022,295

Many changes, such as business closures, working from home, increased psychological distress, and delayed access to health care, could have unique adverse effects on patients diagnosed with chronic pain (CP). The present study sought to examine perceived changes in the CP experience brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Participants included 487 self-reported patients with musculoskeletal, neuropathic, or postsurgical pain recruited using CloudResearch. A 53-item survey was created to assess changes in perceived pain, mood, control over pain, physical activity, employment, and medical access since the onset of the pandemic. RESULTS: Results suggested a worsening of the pain experience, particularly for women, with greater pain, negative affect, sedentary functioning, perceived decline in treatment quality, and increased treatment delays. Of note, pandemic-related declines in control over pain, which represents an important clinical target, are associated with other pandemic-related declines and also mediates relevant associations. CONCLUSIONS: For frontline treatment providers, particularly primary care nurses and physicians, these findings may be relevant in order to reduce the likelihood of a worsening of symptoms, loss of self-efficacy regarding management of pain and/or potential maladaptive increase in the use of pain medications.",2021-10-13,"Chatkoff, David K.; Leonard, Michelle T.; Najdi, Roukaya R.; Cruga, Briana; Forsythe, Alicia; Bourgeau, Celia; Easton, Hillary",Pain Manag Nurs,,document_parses/pdf_json/b664f947e329e638c5c26561b15b8ba7ebfc6ab5.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1524904221002216; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1524904221002216; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmn.2021.10.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34772607/,240593239.0,2021,205

SARS-CoV-2 has emerged as a new etiologic agent for CAP, but the role of CURB-65 and PSI have not been established. Research Question How effective are CURB-65 and PSI at predicting in-hospital mortality from SARS-CoV-2 CAP compared to non-SARS-CoV-2 CAP? Can these clinical prediction rules be optimized to predict mortality in SARS-CoV-2 CAP by addition of procalcitonin and D-dimer? Study Design and Methods Secondary analysis of two prospective cohorts of patients with SARS-CoV-2 CAP or non-SARS-CoV-2 CAP from eight adult hospitals in Louisville, KY. Results The in-hospital mortality rate was 19% for patients with SARS-CoV-2 CAP and 6.5% for patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 CAP. For the PSI score, ROC analysis resulted in AUC of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78 – 0.86) and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.77 – 0.80) for patients with SARS-CoV-2 CAP and non-SARS-CoV-2 CAP, respectively. For the CURB-65 score, ROC analysis resulted in AUC of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.75 – 0.84) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.73 – 0.77) for patients with SARS-CoV-2 CAP and non-SARS-CoV-2 CAP, respectively. In SARS-CoV-2 CAP, addition of D-dimer (optimal cut-off 1813 ug/mL) and procalcitonin (optimal cut-off 0.19 ng/mL) to PSI and CURB-65 provided negligible improvement in prognostic performance. Interpretation PSI and CURB-65 can predict in-hospital mortality for patients with SARS-CoV-2 CAP and non-SARS-CoV-2 CAP comparatively. In patients with SARS-CoV-2 CAP, the inclusion of either D-dimer or procalcitonin to PSI or CURB-65 did not improve the prognostic performance of either score. In patients with CAP, regardless of etiology, PSI and CURB-65 remain adequate for predicting mortality in clinical practice.",2021-11-02,"Bradley, James; Sbaih, Nadine; Chandler, Thomas R.; Furmanek, Stephen; Ramirez, Julio A.; Cavallazzi, Rodrigo",Chest,,document_parses/pdf_json/dbd641212460b3aaad1489f3e058c26949a3f89f.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369221042574; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369221042574?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2021.10.031; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34740594/,240424423.0,2021,275

Diagnostic Yield of Serial COVID-19 Testing in Hospitalized Patients,10.1093/ofid/ofab466.616,PMC8644909,,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: Accurate and rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to prevent nosocomial transmission. Patients with negative COVID-19 tests at admission may still be in the incubation phase during hospitalisation. False negative results can occur when patients are tested too early. The incidence of COVID-19 infections in Montréal, Canada started to increase in December 2020. Because of this rise, on January 4(th), 2021, the Infection Control Service of the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC) recommended serial COVID-19 testing for all admitted patients on days 5 and 10 after admission. The aim of this study is to examine the diagnostic yield of serial COVID-19 testing. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed SARS-CoV-2 test results for patients admitted to the MUHC between January 4, 2021, and April 30, 2021. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from patients for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Multiple testing platforms were used (Roche Cobas 6800, Thermo Scientific(TM) King Fisher and Cepheid GeneXpert) because of the high volume of samples. Tests were classified as admission, day 5, and day 10 tests if they were done on days 0 to 2, 3 to 7, and 8 to 12 respectively. Patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 on admission were excluded from the analyses. The diagnostic yield of serial testing for patients admitted during each month was calculated by dividing the number of patients testing positive on day 5 or day 10 by the total number of patients who underwent serial testing during that month. RESULTS: There were 2945 admissions of 5 days or more and 1777 admissions of 10 days or more. Of these, 1509 patients and 841 patients respectively were serially tested for SARS-CoV-2 as recommended for a compliance rate of 51% at day 5 and 47% at day 10. Ten (0.7%) and 12 (1.4%) patients tested positive on days 5 and 10 respectively. The diagnostic yield of serial testing was highest for patients admitted in January 2021 at 2.2%, when the average daily incidence of COVID-19 was highest in Montréal (see Figure). [Image: see text] The diagnostic yield of serial testing for each month, compared to the average daily COVID-19 incidence rate in Montréal, Québec, Canada. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic yield of serial SARS-CoV-2 testing in hospitalized patients is low when the overall community incidence is low. However, diagnostic yield of serial testing increases when community incidence of COVID-19 is higher and should be considered in this situation.

Thus, the importance of phylogenetic methods is increasingly being recognized, and the development of a novel phylogenetic approach can contribute to several areas of research. Recently, the use of hyperbolic geometry has attracted attention in artificial intelligence research. Hyperbolic space can better represent a hierarchical structure compared to Euclidean space, and can therefore be useful for describing and analyzing a phylogenetic tree. In this study, we developed a novel metric that considers the characteristics of a phylogenetic tree for representation in hyperbolic space. We compared the performance of the proposed hyperbolic embeddings, general hyperbolic embeddings, and Euclidean embeddings, and confirmed that our method could be used to more precisely reconstruct evolutionary distance. We also demonstrate that our approach is useful for predicting the nearest-neighbor node in a partial phylogenetic tree with missing nodes. Furthermore, we proposed a novel approach based on our metric to integrate multiple trees for analyzing tree nodes or imputing missing distances.

As macrophages have unique effector functions as a first-line defense against invading pathogens, we genetically armed human macrophages with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to reprogram their phagocytic activity against SARS-CoV-2. After investigation of CAR constructs with different intracellular receptor domains, we found that although cytosolic domains from MERTK (CARMERTK) did not trigger antigen-specific cellular phagocytosis or killing effects, unlike those from MEGF10, FcRγ and CD3ζ did, these CARs all mediated similar SARS-CoV-2 clearance in vitro. Notably, we showed that CARMERTK macrophages reduced the virion load without upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression.

However, its shortcomings such as broad torque ripple and variable switching frequency have offered several improvements like Space Vector Modulation (SVM) strategy, multilevel inverter (MLI) topology, etc. The conventional DTC which is fed by the two-level inverter has limited voltage vector, results in some difficulties to optimize the operation, especially at low operating speed. In contrast to MLI, the abundant of voltage vector has provided various amplitudes and angles that can overcome the problem of conventional DTC. Thus, this paper introduces the selected optimal voltage vector obtained from five-level Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) inverter that employs in DTC hysteresis-based to achieve better optimization that similar to the DTC-SVM. Initially, the research work begins with an investigation on the performance comparison between a DTC hysteresis-based between two-level inverter (conventional method) and a five-level CHB inverter (proposed method). Here, a DC generator acted as a load is employed to control the operating speed instead of the speed controller (speed controller is negligible). Hence, the DTC method is optimized by minimizing the torque ripple as well as retaining the torque control capability at constant torque region on several operating speed. The selected optimal vector from the look-up table DTC of five-level CHB inverter must be dynamically appropriate to any change of torque (increased or decreased torque). For simplicity, this paper will only discuss the experimental results for both topologies of drive system. From the experimental results, it is verified that the torque ripples by the proposed method have achieved 10% and 50% reduction at high and low operating speed respectively.

To provide a system for understanding and prototyping designs, we have developed a mathematical model of two patients supported by a mechanical ventilator. We propose a standard set-up where we simulate the introduction of T-splitters to supply air to two patients and a modified set-up where we introduce a variable resistance in each inhalation pathway and one-way valves in each exhalation pathway. Using the standard set-up, we demonstrate that ventilating two patients with mismatched lung compliances from a single ventilator will lead to clinically significant reductions in tidal volume in the patient with the lowest respiratory compliance. Using the modified set-up, we demonstrate that it could be possible to achieve the same tidal volumes in two patients with mismatched lung compliances, and we show that the tidal volume of one patient can be manipulated independently of the other. The results indicate that, with appropriate modifications, two patients could be supported from a single ventilator with independent control of tidal volumes.",2020-08-24,"Solís-Lemus, José A.; Costar, Edward; Doorly, Denis; Kerrigan, Eric C.; Kennedy, Caroline H.; Tait, Frances; Niederer, Steven; Vincent, Peter E.; Williams, Steven E.",R Soc Open Sci,,document_parses/pdf_json/caf6b477adc11f1e7977d27fd602042efe2b29bd.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32968521/; https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.200585,221256807.0,2020,188

Nonetheless, acute abdominal surgical emergencies are major causes for nontrauma-related hospital admissions and their incidences were expected to remain unchanged. Surprisingly, a significant decrease in volume and a higher proportion of complicated cases are being observed worldwide. METHODS: The present study assesses the local impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the emergency presentation of acute appendicitis in a Brazilian hospital. A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients undergoing emergency surgery for the clinically suspected diagnosis of acute appendicitis during the 2-month period of March and April 2020 and the same time interval in the previous year. Data on demographics, timing of symptom onset and hospital presentation, intraoperative details, postoperative complications, hospital length of stay, and histological examination of the specimen were retrieved from individual registries. RESULTS: The number of appendectomies during the pandemic was 36, which represents a 56% reduction compared to the 82 patients operated during the same period in 2019. The average time of symptom onset to hospital arrival was significantly higher in 2020 (40.6 vs. 28.2 hours, P = .02). The classification of appendicitis revealed a significant higher proportion of complicated cases than the previous year (33.3% vs. 15.2%, P = .04).

Whether these glycemic changes are specific to a subgroup of patients and persist following COVID-19 resolution remains to be elucidated. This work aimed to characterize longitudinal random blood glucose in a large cohort of nondiabetic patients diagnosed with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: De-identified electronic medical records of 7502 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 without prior diagnosis of diabetes between January 1, 2020, and November 18, 2020, were accessed through the TriNetX Research Network. Glucose measurements, diagnostic codes, medication codes, laboratory values, vital signs, and demographics were extracted before, during, and after COVID-19 diagnosis. Unsupervised time-series clustering algorithms were trained to identify distinct clusters of glucose trajectories. Cluster associations were tested for demographic variables, COVID-19 severity, glucose-altering medications, glucose values, and new-onset diabetes diagnoses. RESULTS: Time-series clustering identified a low-complexity model with 3 clusters and a high-complexity model with 19 clusters as the best-performing models. In both models, cluster membership differed significantly by death status, COVID-19 severity, and glucose levels. Clusters membership in the 19 cluster model also differed significantly by age, sex, and new-onset diabetes mellitus. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This work identified distinct longitudinal blood glucose changes associated with subclinical glucose dysfunction in the low-complexity model and increased new-onset diabetes incidence in the high-complexity model.

This survey aimed to propose long-term changes for ophthalmology training based on the changes experienced by trainees and their perception of new training opportunities. METHODS: An online survey was distributed to ophthalmology trainees in multiple countries. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: A total of 504 analyzable responses were collected from 32 different countries. The current impact of COVID-19 pandemic was described as “severe” by most trainees (55.2%); however, the future perspective was more optimistic as demonstrated by the greater number of responses reporting a presumed “moderate” (37.3%), “mild” (14.1%) or “slight” (4.2%) long-term impact. The vast majority of trainees reported a decrease ≥50% of clinical activity (76.4%) and >75% of surgical activity (74.6%). Although an initial gap in didactic teaching has been experienced by many (55.4%), regular web-based teaching was reportedly attended by 67.7% of the respondents. A strong agreement was found regarding the worthwhile role of web-based case-presentations in clinical training (91.7%), web-based discussion of edited surgical videos (85.7%) and simulation-based practice (86.9%) in surgical training. CONCLUSIONS: This survey, focusing on trainees’ perspective, strongly reinforces the need to promptly include new technology-based training tools, such as web-based teaching, virtual surgical simulators, and telementoring, in long-term reorganisation of ophthalmology training to ensure its continuity and effectiveness, which would remain available even in the face of another unpredictable crisis within the health system.",2020-07-01,"Ferrara, Mariantonia; Romano, Vito; Steel, David H; Gupta, Rajen; Iovino, Claudio; van Dijk, Elon H.

Finding bacterial genetic variants that might contribute to patient death is of interest to better understand infection progression and implement diagnostic methods that specifically look for those factors. E. coli samples isolated from patients with BSI are an ideal dataset to systematically search for those variants, as long as the influence of host factors such as comorbidities are taken into account. Here we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using data from 912 patients with E. coli BSI from hospitals in Paris, France. We looked for associations between bacterial genetic variants and three patient outcomes (death at 28 days, septic shock and admission to intensive care unit), as well as two portals of entry (urinary and digestive tract), using various clinical variables from each patient to account for host factors. We did not find any association between genetic variants and patient outcomes, potentially confirming the strong influence of host factors in influencing the course of BSI; we however found a strong association between the papGII operon and entrance of E. coli through the urinary tract, which demonstrates the power of bacterial GWAS when applied to actual clinical data. Despite the lack of associations between E. coli genetic variants and patient outcomes, we estimate that increasing the sample size by one order of magnitude could lead to the discovery of some putative causal variants.

There are about 50 different breeds of domestic rabbits. Rabbits have very thin and delicate skin that is covered with fine fur comprised of both a soft undercoat and stiff guard hairs. Care must be taken when clipping fur because the skin is prone to tearing. A rabbit enclosure should be large enough to provide a sleeping space, eating space, and latrine. Animals housed for long periods of time should also have ample room to exercise. The enclosure should be tall enough to allow the rabbit to sit up and not have its ears touch the top of the cage. Because rabbits are prone to heatstroke, they should be housed in temperatures ranging from 60°F to 75°F. If rabbits are housed outdoors, they must have access to shade and clean water, and the shelter should protect them from the elements as well as from predators. The ideal substrate for rabbits is grass hay; however, for indoor, caged rabbits, a foam rubber pad or a towel covered with newspaper and a thick layer of timothy hay can also be used.",2009-12-31,"Vennen, Kristine M.; Mitchell, Mark A.",Manual of Exotic Pet Practice,,document_parses/pdf_json/7a856e19b6c14cf6cf82bcb7da8729dd2169acea.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9781416001195500172; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9781416001195500172,106979268.0,2009,194

Therapies for MDS are lacking, particularly those that impact the early stages of disease. We developed a model of MDS using zebrafish using knockout of Rps14, the primary mediator of the anaemia associated with del (5q) MDS. These mutant animals display dose- and age-dependent abnormalities in haematopoiesis, culminating in bone marrow failure with dysplastic features. We utilized rps14 knockdown to undertake an in vivo small molecule screen to identify compounds that ameliorate the MDS phenotype, identifying imiquimod, an agonist of TLR7 and TLR8. Imiquimod alleviates anaemia by promoting haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell expansion and erythroid differentiation, the mechanism of which is dependent on TLR7 ligation and Myd88. TLR7 activation in this setting paradoxically promoted an anti-inflammatory gene signature indicating crosstalk between pro-inflammatory pathways endogenous to Rps14 loss and NFkappaB pathway via TLR7.

The main objective of this study was to identify risk factors associated with psychosocial distress among HCWs working in a hospital environment during the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional descriptive survey involving HCWs of a tertiary care hospital was completed using an online survey software (Google Forms). The survey collected respondents' sociodemographic data, perception towards personal protective equipment (PPE) and knowledge about COVID-19, and satisfaction score towards performance of the World Health Organization, the Malaysian police, civil service, healthcare system, and government. Psychosocial distress was assessed using the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12). RESULTS A total of 675 responses were collected. Female gender and doctors were identified to be associated with greater psychosocial impact from the pandemic among the HCWs. Several factors such as self-rated health status, confidence level towards PPE in disease prevention, degree of familiarity in using PPE, knowledge regarding care for COVID-19 patients, and capability in answering questions asked by the public regarding the disease were found to be associated with the degree of psychosocial impact from the pandemic. CONCLUSION This study identified the vulnerable groups of HCWs at risk of psychosocial distress and its associated risk factors. These findings highlight the need for strategies to reduce risks and to prioritise psychological support and intervention during the pandemic.",2022-03-01,"Siow, S L; Chuah, J S; Roslani, A C; Mahendran, H A; Ratnasingam, S; Bujang, M A",The Medical journal of Malaysia,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35338622/,247712697.0,2022,236

At the end of March 2020, the first and so far largest outbreak of the disease occurred in a retirement home in Hamburg. METHODS: Analysis of procedures in dealing with a residential unit affected by SARS-CoV‑2, accommodating a risk group of 60 seniors with dementia is presented as well as a detailed presentation of post-mortem examination results of all 8 deceased tested positive for SARS-CoV‑2. RESULTS: Out of 60 residents, 39 were infected by SARS-CoV‑2. Due to preventive procedures it was possible to stop further spreading of the infection to other residential areas. In all 8 fatal cases, the autopsy diagnosis was death due to COVID-19. Autopsies revealed all COVID-19 patients to have a fatal (broncho)pneumonia and signs of relevant pre-existing cardiac, renal and pulmonary conditions in all cases. In 75% (n = 6) of the cases a fresh venous thrombosis was found. In 66.7% (n = 4) of the cases thrombotic events were combined with peripheral pulmonary artery thromboembolisms. CONCLUSION: The cohort of SARS-CoV‑2 infected residents of a nursing home is characteristic for clinical and epidemiological features of the new coronavirus disease. Due to a centralized evaluation of all fatalities at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Hamburg, a detailed examination of all deceased positive for SARS-CoV‑2 was possible. Thereby, increased case fatality rates of approximately 20% could in all cases be assigned to a relevant number of pre-existing comorbidities of multiple organ systems, which was consistent with the clinical data available.",2020-07-05,"Klein, A.; Edler, C.; Fitzek, A.; Fröb, D.; Heinemann, A.; Meißner, K.; Mushumba, H.; Püschel, K.; Schröder, A.

ABSTRACT: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are the treatment of choice for BCR-ABL1-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Although TKIs have substantially improved prognosis of CML patients, their use is not free of adverse effects. Dasatinib is a second generation TKI frequently associated with pleural effusion in up to 33% of patients. This results in symptoms as dyspnea, cough and chest pain that may require therapy discontinuation. In the present report, we describe two exceptional cases of HHV8-negative large B-cell effusion-based lymphoma (EBL) confined to the pleura, incidentally, diagnosed in patients presenting with dasatinib-related pleural effusion. One patient (case 1) is alive and is in remission at 17 months from large B-cell EBL diagnosis while unfortunately the other patient (case 2) died of progressive disease and COVID-19 pneumonia 16 months from large B-cell EBL diagnosis. These cases raise concern about a possible association between large B-cell EBL and dasatinib, and the different clinical outcome of the two cases poses a challenge in treatment decision. For this reason, we strongly recommend cytological investigation in patients with persistent/relapsing pleural effusion under dasatinib, primarily to validate its possible association with lymphoma development and to improve the knowledge about this entity.",2021-02-14,"Fiori, Stefano; Todisco, Elisabetta; Ramadan, Safaa; Gigli, Federica; Falco, Patrizia; Iurlo, Alessandra; Rampinelli, Cristiano; Croci, Giorgio; Pileri, Stefano A.; Tarella, Corrado",Biology (Basel),,document_parses/pdf_json/f4f508cb7e621394980d42371b1f40bd8c62c7f7.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33672947/; https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10020152,232086161.0,2021,326

The research agenda posits the following questions. Questions around HIV infection, transmission, and diagnosis include: (i) molecular, genetic, clinical, and environmental assessments of COVID-19 in people living with HIV, (ii) alternative options for facility-based HIV testing services such as self- and home-based HIV testing, and (iii) COVID-19 related sexual violence and mental health on HIV transmission and early diagnosis. These and related questions could be assessed using Biopsychosocial and socio-ecological models. Questions around HIV treatment include: (i) the effect of COVID-19 on HIV treatment services, (ii) alternative options for facility-based treatment provision such as community-based antiretroviral therapy groups, and (iii) equitable distribution of treatment and vaccines for COVID-19, if successful. Bickman's logic model and the social determinants of health framework could guide these issues. The impact of stigma, the role of leveraging lessons on sustained intra-behavioral change, the role of medical mistrust and conspiracy beliefs, and the role of digital health on integrated management of HIV care and spectrum of care of COVID-19 need assessment using several frameworks including Goffman's stigma framework, Luhmann's Trust theory, and Gidden's theory of structuration.

Older adults (aged >65 years) are perceived as the most physiologically susceptible population to developing COVID-19 and are at risk of secondary mental health challenges related to the social isolation that has been imposed by virus containment strategies. To mitigate concerns regarding sampling bias, we analyzed a random sample of older adults to understand the uptake and acceptance of technologies that support socialization during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to conduct a population-based assessment of the barriers and facilitators to engaging in the use of technology for web-based socialization among older adults in the Canadian province of British Columbia during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, population-based, regionally representative survey by using the random-digit dialing method to reach participants aged >65 years who live in British Columbia. Data were analyzed using SPSS (IBM Corporation), and open-text responses were analyzed via thematic analysis. RESULTS: Respondents included 400 older adults aged an average of 72 years, and 63.7% (n=255) of respondents were female. Most respondents (n=358, 89.5%) were aware of how to use technology to connect with others, and slightly more than half of the respondents (n=224, 56%) reported that, since the beginning of the pandemic, they used technology differently to connect with others during the pandemic. Additionally, 55.9% (n=223) of respondents reported that they adopted new technology since the beginning of the pandemic. Older adults reported the following key barriers to using technology: (1) a lack of access (including finance-, knowledge-, and age-related issues); (2) a lack of interest (including a preference for telephones and a general lack of interest in computers); and (3) physical barriers (resultant of cognitive impairments, stroke, and arthritis). Older adults also reported the following facilitators: (1) a knowledge of technologies (from self-teaching or external courses); (2) reliance on others (family, friends, and general internet searches); (3) technology accessibility (including appropriate environments, user-friendly technology, and clear instructions); and (4) social motivation (everyone else is doing it). CONCLUSIONS: Much data on older adults’ use of technology are limited by sampling biases, but this study, which used a random sampling method, demonstrated that older adults used technology to mitigate social isolation during the pandemic. Web-based socialization is the most promising method for mitigating potential mental health effects that are related to virus containment strategies. Providing telephone training; creating task lists; and implementing the facilitators described by participants, such as facilitated socialization activities, are important strategies for addressing barriers, and these strategies can be implemented during and beyond the pandemic to bolster the mental health needs of older adults.",2021-04-23,"Haase, Kristen R; Cosco, Theodore; Kervin, Lucy; Riadi, Indira; O'Connell, Megan E",JMIR Aging,,document_parses/pdf_json/7cb35c3c370f2df0178c8ddb53014ed66f1c841a.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33739929/; https://doi.org/10.2196/28010,232301086.0,2021,438

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine whether a bottom-up, unsupervised, machine learning approach, could more accurately support concussion subtyping. Methods: Initial patient intake data as well as objective outcome measures including, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing Tool (ImPACT) were retrospectively extracted from the Advance Concussion Clinic's database. A correlation matrix and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. Sklearn's agglomerative clustering algorithm was then applied, and the optimal number of clusters within the patient database were generated. Between-group comparisons among the formed clusters were performed using a Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Two hundred seventy-five patients within the clinics database were analyzed. Five distinct clusters emerged from the data when maximizing the Silhouette score (0.36) and minimizing the Davies-Bouldin score (0.83). Concussion subtypes derived demonstrated clinically distinct profiles, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between all five clusters. Conclusion: This machine learning approach enabled the identification and characterization of five distinct concussion subtypes, which were best understood according to levels of complexity, ranging from Extremely Complex to Minimally Complex.

Parenchymal rupture usually occurs in patients with renal cell carcinoma, angiomyolipoma, renal cysts, arteriovenous malformation or vascular diseases such as periarteritis nodosa. Collecting system rupture is usually a rare complication of obstructive urolithiasis. We describe the unusual cases of spontaneous kidney rupture in patients with acute urinary obstruction.

The patient reached our emergency department with acute left flank pain and massive haematuria. At the moment of admission, the patient was in stage III hypovolemic shock and had a lower haematocrit (haemoglobin = 4.9 g/dL). Despite blood transfusions, emergency surgical exploration, extrafascial nephrectomy and intensive support care, the patient died twelve hours after surgery. CONCLUSIONS Parenchymal renal rupture can be a life-threatening emergency.

The vaccines currently available on the market elicit only limited protection. Recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replicon particles (VRP) have been used successfully to induce protection against influenza A virus (IAV) in chickens and bluetongue virus in sheep. In this study, VSV VRP expressing the PRRSV envelope proteins GP5, M, GP4, GP3, GP2 and the nucleocapsid protein N, individually or in combination, were generated and evaluated as a potential vector vaccine against PRRSV infection. High level expression of the recombinant PRRSV proteins was demonstrated in cell culture. However, none of the PRRSV antigens expressed from VRP, with the exception of the N protein, did induce any detectable antibody response in pigs before challenge infection with PRRSV. After challenge however, the antibody responses against GP5, GP4 and GP3 appeared in average 2 weeks earlier than in pigs vaccinated with the empty control VRP. No reduction of viremia was observed in the vaccinated group compared with the control group. When pigs were co-vaccinated with VRP expressing IAV antigens and VRP expressing PRRSV glycoproteins, only antibody responses to the IAV antigens were detectable. These data show that the VSV replicon vector can induce immune responses to heterologous proteins in pigs, but that the PRRSV envelope proteins expressed from VSV VRP are poorly immunogenic. Nevertheless, they prime the immune system for significantly earlier B-cell responses following PRRSV challenge infection.",2016-02-19,"Eck, Melanie; Durán, Margarita García; Ricklin, Meret E.; Locher, Samira; Sarraseca, Javier; Rodríguez, María José; McCullough, Kenneth C.; Summerfield, Artur; Zimmer, Gert; Ruggli, Nicolas",Vet Res,,document_parses/pdf_json/f3869eb49905ee75dbd6acd2964cb74f69154b2a.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26895704/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13567-016-0318-0,15955363.0,2016,250

5eowif3a,,Medline,Distance Assessment for Detecting Cognitive Impairment in Older Adults: A Systematic Review of Psychometric Evidence.,10.1159/000511945,,33291097,unk,"INTRODUCTION Distance or remote cognitive assessments, administered via phone or computer platforms, have emerged as possible alternatives to traditional assessments performed during office visits. Distance refers to any nontraditional assessment feature, not only or necessarily location. We conducted a systematic review to examine the psychometric soundness of these approaches. METHOD We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, AgeLine, and Academic Search Premier for articles published between January 2008 and June 2020. Studies were included if participants were over the age of 50, a structured assessment of cognitive function in older adults was evaluated, the assessment method was deemed distant, and validity and/or reliability data were reported. Assessment distance was defined as having any of the following features: use of an electronic test interface, nonroutine test location (e.g., home), test self-administered, and test unsupervised. Distance was categorized as low, intermediate, or high. RESULTS/DISCUSSION Twenty-six studies met inclusion criteria. Sample sizes ranged from n = 8 to 8,627, and the mean age ranged from 57 to 83. Assessments included screens, brief or full batteries, and were performed via videoconferencing, phone, smartphone, or tablet/computer. Ten studies reported on low distance, 11 on intermediate distance, and 5 studies for high distance assessments. Invalid performance data were observed with older age and cognitive impairment. Convergent validity data were reported consistently and suggested a decline with increasing distance: r = 0.52-0.80 for low, 0.49-0.75 for intermediate, and 0.41-0.53 for high distance.

Using next-generation sequencing and in silico haplotype reconstruction, we analyzed whole-genome sequences from longitudinal plasma samples of eight chronically infected HIV-1-positive individuals failing 2nd-line regimens from the French National Agency for AIDS and Viral Hepatitis Research (ANRS) 12249 Treatment as Prevention (TasP) trial. On nonsuppressive ART, there were large fluctuations in synonymous and nonsynonymous variant frequencies despite stable viremia. Reconstructed haplotypes provided evidence for selective sweeps during periods of partial adherence, and viral haplotype competition, during periods of low drug exposure. Drug resistance mutations in reverse transcriptase (RT) were used as markers of viral haplotypes in the reservoir, and their distribution over time indicated recombination. We independently observed linkage disequilibrium decay, indicative of recombination. These data highlight dramatic changes in virus population structure that occur during stable viremia under nonsuppressive ART. IMPORTANCE HIV-1 infections are most commonly initiated with a single founder virus and are characterized by extensive inter- and intraparticipant genetic diversity. However, existing literature on HIV-1 intrahost population dynamics is largely limited to untreated infections, predominantly in subtype B-infected individuals. The manuscript characterizes viral population dynamics in long-term viremic treatment-experienced individuals, which has not been previously characterized. These data are particularly relevant for understanding HIV dynamics but can also be applied to other RNA viruses.

In this review, we propose a procedure for CPR in the ICU that minimizes the number of personnel in the immediate vicinity of the patient and conserves the use of scarce personal protection equipment (PPE). Highlighting the low likelihood of successful resuscitation in high risk patients may prompt them to decline CPR. We recommend the preemptive placement of central venous lines in high risk patients with intravenous tubing extensions that allow medication delivery from outside the patients’ rooms. During CPR, this practice can be used to deliver critical medications without delay. The use of a mechanical compression system for CPR further reduces the risk of infectious exposure to health care providers.

For half a century scientists have pursued the hypothesis that these diseases involve a chronic viral infection in the brain. However, efforts to consistently detect a specific virus in brains of patients with such diseases as Alzheimer’s or multiple sclerosis have generally failed. Neuropathologists have become increasingly aware that most patients with neurodegenerative diseases demonstrate marked deterioration of the brain olfactory bulb in addition to brain targets that define the specific disease. In fact, the loss of the sense of smell may precede overt neurological symptoms by many years. This realization that the olfactory bulb is a common target in neurodegenerative diseases suggests the possibility that microbes and/or toxins in inhaled air may play a role in their pathogenesis. With regard to inhaled viruses, neuropathologists have focused on those viruses that infect and kill neurons. However, a recent study shows that a respiratory virus with no neurotropic properties can rapidly invade the mouse olfactory bulb from the nasal cavity. Available data suggest that this strain of influenza is passively transported to the bulb via the olfactory nerves (mechanism unknown), and is taken up by glial cells in the outer layers of the bulb. The infected glial cells appear to be activated by the virus, secrete proinflammatory cytokines, and block further spread of virus within the brain. At the time that influenza symptoms become apparent (15 h post-infection), but not prior to symptom onset (10 h post-infection), proinflammatory cytokine-expressing neurons are increased in olfactory cortical pathways and hypothalamus as well as in the olfactory bulb. The mice go on to die of pneumonitis with severe acute phase and respiratory disease symptoms but no classical neurological symptoms. While much remains to be learned about this intranasal influenza-brain invasion model, it suggests the hypothesis that common viruses encountered in our daily life may initiate neuroinflammation via olfactory neural networks. The numerous viruses that we inhale during a lifetime might cause the death of only a few neurons per infection, but this minor damage would accumulate over time and contribute to age-related brain shrinkage and/or neurodegenerative diseases. Elderly individuals with a strong innate inflammatory system, or ongoing systemic inflammation (or both), might be most susceptible to these outcomes. The evidence for the hypothesis that common respiratory viruses may contribute to neurodegenerative processes is developed in the accompanying article.",2010-03-16,"Majde, Jeannine A.",Med Hypotheses,,document_parses/pdf_json/157257619334dee253b18e136d7234e6e871ea9e.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20236772/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987710000885; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987710000885; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2010.02.023,19565373.0,2010,400

Therefore, we updated a previous systematic review to determine the efficacy and safety of NMBAs in ARDS. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE (October 2012 to July 2019), the Cochrane (Central) database, and clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN Register, and WHO ICTRP) for RCTs comparing the effects of NMBA as a continuous infusion versus placebo or no NMBA infusion (but allowing intermittent NMBA boluses) on patient-important outcomes for adults with ARDS. Two independent reviewers assessed the methodologic quality of the primary studies and abstracted data. RESULTS: Seven RCTs, including four new RCTs, met eligibility criteria for this review. These trials enrolled 1598 patients with moderate to severe ARDS at centers in the USA, France, and China. All trials assessed short-term continuous infusions of cisatracurium or vecuronium. The pooled estimate for mortality outcomes showed significant statistical heterogeneity, which was only explained by a subgroup analysis by depth of sedation in the control arm. A continuous NMBA infusion did not improve mortality when compared to a light sedation strategy with no NMBA infusion (relative risk [RR] 0.99; 95% CI 0.86–1.15; moderate certainty; P = 0.93). On the other hand, continuous NMBA infusion reduced mortality when compared to deep sedation with as needed NMBA boluses (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.57–0.89; low certainty; P = 0.003). Continuous NMBA infusion reduced the rate of barotrauma (RR 0.55; 95% CI 0.35–0.85, moderate certainty; P = 0.008) across eligible trials, but the effect on ventilator-free days, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU-acquired weakness was uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Inconsistency in study methods and findings precluded the pooling of all trials for mortality. In a pre-planned sensitivity analysis, the impact of NMBA infusion on mortality depends on the strategy used in the control arm, showing reduced mortality when compared to deep sedation, but no effect on mortality when compared to lighter sedation. In both situations, a continuous NMBA infusion may reduce the risk of barotrauma, but the effects on other patient-important outcomes remain unclear.

Methods We conducted individual semi-structured interviews of child and adolescent psychiatrists (n = 24) practicing in the US. Participants were selected as a diverse purposive sample of active members of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP). We analyzed anonymized transcripts through iterative coding using thematic analysis aided by NVivo software. Results We identified three main thematic domains within participants’ response to the pandemic, which have engendered a reevaluation of and a recommitment to the aims of each clinician and the field of CAP more broadly. These domains, paired with representative questions, include: 1) Unsettling , or “who have we been?” (identifying discontents such as daily inefficiencies and intraprofessional loss of trust); 2) Adaptation , or “who are we now?” (exploring affordances and limitations of virtual work, and the evolution of personal and professional identity); and 3) Reimagination , or “who will we become?” (renewing a commitment to psychiatry as advocacy). Even as we identified a collective agreement toward the need for implementing change, just what needs to change, and how that change will be realized, remain contested. Conclusion These three thematic domains, augmented by a national confrontation with race and equity, have engendered a field-wide reckoning with known inequities. They have reinvigorated collective responses and calls to action. The divergent mindsets to change and leadership have provided an aperture for what values and practices the field might instill in its next generation of practitioners.",2021-03-04,"DiGiovanni, Madeline; Weller, Indigo; Martin, Andres",Res Sq,,document_parses/pdf_json/c5e444a1b3ce6394e20006deeb7a96ef19e2d598.json,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-287057/v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688641/,232168994.0,2021,273

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study analysing patient responsiveness to our RPM survey or telemedicine visits and outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Daily text message surveys and telemedicine consultations were offered to all patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at our institutional screening centres. Survey respondents with alarm responses were contacted by a nurse. We assessed the relationship between virtual engagement (telemedicine or RPM survey response) and clinical outcomes using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Between 10 July 2020 and 2 January 2021, 6822 patients tested positive, with 1230 (18%) responding to at least one survey. Compared with non-responders, responders were younger (49 vs 53 years) and more likely to be white (40% vs 33%) and female (65% vs 55%) and had fewer comorbidities. After adjustment, individuals who engaged virtually were less likely to experience an emergency department visit, hospital admission or intensive care unit–level care.

Today’s cryo-EM maps can frequently reach the atomic-level resolution, while often containing a range of resolutions, with conformationally variable regions obtained at 6 Å or worse. Low resolution density maps obtained for protein flexible domains, as well as the ensemble of coexisting conformational states arising from cryo-EM, poses new challenges and opportunities for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. With the ability to describe the biomolecular dynamics at the atomic level, MD can extend the capabilities of cryo-EM, capturing the conformational variability and predicting biologically relevant short-lived conformational states. Here, we report about the state-of-the-art MD procedures that are currently used to refine, reconstruct and interpret cryo-EM maps. We show the capability of MD to predict short-lived conformational states, finding remarkable confirmation by cryo-EM structures subsequently solved. This has been the case of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing machinery, whose catalytically active structure has been predicted through both long-time scale MD and enhanced sampling techniques 2 years earlier than cryo-EM.

Methods: Publicly available data as of August 26, 2021, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were used to calculate presumed population immunity by state. Seroprevalence data were used to estimate the percentage of the population previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, with adjustments for underreporting. Vaccination coverage data for both fully and partially vaccinated persons were used to calculate presumed immunity from vaccination. Finally, we estimated the percentage of the total population in each state with presumed immunity to SARS-CoV-2, with a sensitivity analysis to account for waning immunity, and compared these estimates to a range of population immunity thresholds. Results: Presumed population immunity varied among states (43.1% to 70.6%), with 19 states with 60% or less of their population having been infected or vaccinated. Four states have presumed immunity greater than thresholds estimated to be sufficient to disrupt transmission of less infectious variants (67%), and none were greater than the threshold estimated for more infectious variants (78% or higher).

Unmasking the state-wise variation in the effect of the nationwide lockdown on the progression of the pandemic could inform dynamic policy interventions towards containment and mitigation. METHODS: Using data on confirmed COVID-19 cases across 20 states that accounted for more than 99% of the cumulative case counts in India till May 31, 2020, we illustrate the masking of state-level trends and highlight the variations across states by presenting evaluative evidence on some aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak: case-fatality rates, doubling times of cases, effective reproduction numbers, and the scale of testing. RESULTS: The estimated effective reproduction number R for India was 3.36 (95% confidence interval (CI): [3.03, 3.71]) on March 24, whereas the average of estimates from May 25 - May 31 stands at 1.27 (95% CI: [1.26, 1.28]). Similarly, the estimated doubling time across India was at 3.56 days on March 24, and the past 7-day average for the same on May 31 is 14.37 days. The average daily number of tests have increased from 1,717 (March 19–25) to 131,772 (May 25–31) with an estimated testing shortfall of 4.58 million tests nationally by May 31. However, various states exhibit substantial departures from these national patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of change over lockdown periods indicate the lockdown has been effective in slowing the spread of the virus nationally. The COVID-19 outbreak in India displays large state-level variations and identifying these variations can help in both understanding the dynamics of the pandemic and formulating effective public health interventions.

Particularly, viral replication and assembly often take place in viral factories where specific viral and cellular proteins as well as nucleic acids concentrate. Viral factories can be either membrane-delimited or devoid of any cellular membranes. In the latter case, they are referred as membrane-less replication compartments. The most emblematic ones are the Negri bodies, which are inclusion bodies that constitute the hallmark of rabies virus infection. Interestingly, Negri bodies and several other viral replication compartments have been shown to arise from a liquid-liquid phase separation process and, thus, constitute a new class of liquid organelles.

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional descriptive qualitative study with focus groups, on HIV micro-research training, with undergraduate health professions students and faculty mentors across three partner institutions in rural Uganda. RESULTS: A total of 24 students and 13 mentors (5–8 per group) took part in the focus group discussions. Most participants stated that the HEPI-TUITAH micro-research program was acceptable, appropriate and feasible for health professions undergraduate students. The interprofessional education approach of bringing together students from different programs and years of study was valuable especially for peer mentorship. There was a need to provide for institution-based training in addition to the centrally organized training for the benefit of all the team members. Participants also noted a need for the program to find a way of providing the students with data collection experience even with the COVID-19 pandemic situation. CONCLUSION: The HEPI-TUITAH micro-research program was perceived as acceptable, appropriate, and feasible for health professions undergraduate students. It also promoted teamwork and academic collaboration.

In the current study, Scenedesmus acutus (S. acutus) was grown under varying nutrient (sulphur and phosphorus) concentrations to enhance the EPS production, and the isolated EPS were assessed for their effect on cell proliferation using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Five different concentrations of MgSO(4) (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.25 g/L) and K(2)HPO(4) (0, 0.2, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 g/L) were taken as compared to the normal culture conditions (0.75 g/L MgSO(4) and 0.4 g/L K(2)HPO(4)) with the intention to enrich EPS secretion. LC–MS, FTIR and NMR analysis revealed that isolated EPS have the characteristic spectrum of hetero-polysaccharides (octa-saccharides). Immunostimulatory property of EPS was demonstrated by their ability to augment PBMC proliferation as measured by MTT assay. Further, increase in the glucose content and proliferative index was observed for EPS obtained under higher concentrations of MgSO(4) (1 and 1.25 g/L) and K(2)HPO(4) (0.6 and 0.8 g/L) relative to normal culture conditions. Effects of the generated EPS under varying concentration of MgSO(4) (r = 0.84–0.99) and K(2)HPO(4) (r = 0.76–0.97) remained strongly correlated with cell count, chlorophyll content, total biomass, glucose, proliferative index and its scavenging activity. Collectively, our data not only showed that EPS generated by S. acutus under higher concentration of K(2)HPO(4) and MgSO(4) possess improved immunostimulatory properties, but also provides convincing evidence towards nutritional optimization of alga for enhanced EPS production with better bioactivities.

More recently, antigen-specific B-cell selection and display technologies are also gaining importance. A major limitation of these approaches used for antibody discovery is the extensive process of cloning and expression involved in transitioning from antibody identification to validating the function, which compromises the throughput of antibody discovery. In this study, we describe a process to identify and rapidly re-format and express antibodies for functional characterization. We used two different approaches to isolate antibodies to five different targets: 1) flow cytometry to identify antigen-specific single B cells from the spleen of immunized human immunoglobulin transgenic mice; and 2) panning of phage libraries. PCR amplification allowed recovery of paired V(H) and V(L) sequences from 79% to 96% of antigen-specific B cells. All cognate V(H) and V(L) transcripts were formatted into transcription and translation compatible linear DNA expression cassettes (LEC) encoding whole IgG or Fab. Between 92% and 100% of paired V(H) and V(L) transcripts could be converted to LECs, and nearly 100% of them expressed as antibodies when transfected into Expi293F cells. The concentration of IgG in the cell culture supernatants ranged from 0.05 µg/ml to 145.8 µg/ml (mean = 18.4 µg/ml). Antigen-specific binding was displayed by 78–100% of antibodies.

Unfortunately, all these systemic, cellular, and molecular changes in maternal physiology also make the mother and the fetus more prone to adverse outcomes, including numerous alterations arising from viral infections. Common infections during pregnancy that have long been recognized as congenitally and perinatally transmissible to newborns include toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex viruses (originally coined as ToRCH infections). In addition, enterovirus, parvovirus B19, hepatitis virus, varicella-zoster virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Zika and Dengue virus, and, more recently, coronavirus infections including Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections (especially the novel SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), constitute relevant targets for current research on maternal-fetal interactions in viral infections during pregnancy. Appropriate maternal education from preconception to the early postnatal period is crucial to promote healthy pregnancies in general and to prevent and/or reduce the impact of viral infections in particular. Specifically, an adequate lifestyle based on proper nutrition plans and feeding interventions, whenever possible, might be crucial to reduce the risk of virus-related gestational diseases and accompanying complications in later life.

The effect of the drugs on pannexin1 channels was assessed at a functional level by means of measurement of extracellular ATP release. Immunoblot analysis and real-time quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to study the potential of the drugs to alter pannexin1 protein and mRNA expression levels, respectively. Favipiravir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and the combination of lopinavir with ritonavir were found to inhibit pannexin1 channel activity without affecting pannexin1 protein or mRNA levels.

DESIGN Mixed-method systematic review. DATA SOURCES Bibliographic databases were searched without date restriction up to June 2019: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Joanna Briggs and Cochrane Libraries. Back issues of leading critical care and patient experience journals were manually searched, as were the reference lists of included studies. All evaluation studies of relevant intervention activities were included; all research designs and outcome measures were eligible. Due to heterogeneity in interventions, designs and outcome measures, the synthesis followed a narrative approach. Service users met with the research team termly. RESULTS Out of 4962 possible citations, a total of 20 studies were included. The overall evidence base was assessed as moderate to weak. Six categories of interventions were identified: environmental unit changes (n=2), web-based support (n=4), discussion-based support (n=6), multicomponent support (n=4), participation in rounds (n=3) and participation in physical care (n=1). Clinical and methodological heterogeneity across studies hindered meta-analysis, hence a narrative synthesis was pursued. Six main outcomes were identified, grouped under two categories: (i) involvement outcomes: communication (mean difference ranged from 6.39 to 8.83), decision-making (mean difference ranged from -0.8 to 5.85), satisfaction (mean difference ranged from 0.15 to 2.48); and (ii) health outcomes: family trauma (mean difference ranged from -7.12 to 0.9), family well-being (mean difference ranged from -0.7 to -4), patient outcomes (relative risk ranged from 1.27 to 4.91). The findings from the qualitative studies were thematically analysed to identify features of the interventions that participants perceived to influence effectiveness. Synthesised into five overarching categories (practicality, development, interaction, reflexivity and bridging), these can serve as principles to inform the future design and development of more refined family member involvement interventions. CONCLUSIONS Future interventions should be developed with much closer family member input and designed by considering the key features we identified. We call for future interventions to be multilayered and allow for a greater or lesser level, and different kinds, of involvement for family members. Choice of intervention should be informed by a baseline diagnostic of family members' needs, readiness and preparedness for involvement.

METHODS: This study identified the relationship between HOXB5 and glioma by investigating HOXB5 expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genotype Tissue Expression databases and validating the obtained data using the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas database. Western blots were used to identify HOXB5 expression levels in glioma cells and clinical samples. Kaplan–Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the prognostic value of HOXB5. The key functions and signaling pathways related to HOXB5 were analyzed using GO, KEGG, and GSEA. Immune infiltration was calculated using the microenvironment cell populations-counter, estimate the proportion of immune and cancer, and ESTIMATE algorithms. RESULTS: The expression of HOXB5 was upregulated in glioma and generally increased with malignancy. HOXB5 was an independent prognostic factor for glioma patients. A nomogram was further built that integrated HOXB5, and it showed stratifying prediction accuracy and efficiency. HOXB5 was associated with the regulation of cell growth, endothelial cell growth, and the IL-6/JAK-STAT3 pathway, and was determined to possibly promote stomatal specimen enrichment and angiogenesis.

In addition, the hybridization of C. batrachus and C. gariepinus is considered a threat to the indigenous population. Although the government of Bangladesh has banned the farming of C. gariepinus, this species has been identified in local markets, and evidence of hybridization between C. gariepinus and C. batrachus has been found. This study revealed genetic erosion of native C. batrachus by the gene sequences of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and cytochrome b. The phylogenetic tree confirmed the occurrences of hybridization between C. gariepinus and C. batrachus. Genetic erosion in the native catfish population is alarming for aquaculture sustainability and biodiversity conservation in Bangladesh. ABSTRACT: The African catfish Clarias gariepinus has been introduced for aquaculture in Bangladesh due to the scarcity of indigenous C. batrachus fingerlings. However, the government of Bangladesh has banned the farming of C. gariepinus due to the carnivorous nature of this species. Recently C. gariepinus has been reported by fish farmers and consumers in Bangladesh, and unplanned hybridization between native and exotic species has been suspected. This study attempts to know the purity of C. batrachus by analyzing mitochondrial genes. Both directly sequenced and retrieved Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cytb) genes from C. gareipinus and C. batrachus were analyzed by MEGA software. The morphologically dissimilar C. batrachus showed the least genetic distance (0.295) from C. gariepinus, which provided evidence of hybridization between the two species. Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees showed that C. batrachus from Bangladesh did not cluster with C. batrachus of other countries, instead C. batrachus clustered with the exotic C. gariepinus. The suspected hybrid formed sister taxa with the exotic C. gariepinus. The study corroborates the genetic deterioration of C. batrachus by unplanned hybridization with the invasive C. gariepinus. Unplanned hybridization has deleterious consequences; therefore, immediate action is necessary for aquaculture sustainability and biodiversity conservation in Bangladesh.",2022-02-06,"Parvez, Imran; Rumi, Rukaya Akter; Ray, Purnima Rani; Hassan, Mohammad Mahbubul; Sultana, Shirin; Pervin, Rubaiya; Suwanno, Suvit; Pradit, Siriporn",Biology (Basel),,document_parses/pdf_json/eccd2c71bf22ef26c0acc7e9fa5f547c3dc0a6d9.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8869340/,,2022,379

Many, if not most, of all important zoonoses relate in some way to animals in the food production chain. Therefore, the food becomes an important vehicle for many, but not all, of these zoonotic pathogens. One of the major issues in food safety over the latest decennia has been the lack of cross-sectoral collaboration across the food production chain. Major food safety events have been significantly affected by the lack of collaboration between the animal health, the food control, and the human health sector. Examples range from BSE and E. coli outbreaks over dioxin crises to intentional melamine contamination. One Health formulates clearly both the need for and the benefit of cross-sectoral collaboration. In this chapter, we will focus on the human health risk related to zoonotic microorganisms present both in food animals and food from these animals, and typically transmitted to humans through food. We focus on these issues because they are very important in relation to the human disease burden, but also because this is the area where some experience of cross-sectoral collaboration already exist. Food related zoonoses can be separated in three major classes: parasites, bacteria, and viruses. While parasites often relate to very specific animal hosts and contribute significantly to the human disease burden, virus have often been related to major, well-published global outbreaks, e.g. SARS and avian- and swine-influenza. The bacterial zoonoses on the other hand often result in sporadic, but very wide-spread disease cases, resulting in a major disease burden in all countries, e.g. Salmonella and Campylobacter. Next to these traditional zoonotic problems, the use of antimicrobials in (food) animals has also caused the emergence of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) zoonotic bacteria. It is important to realize the difference in the nature of disease epidemiology, as well as, in society’s reaction to these diseases in different socio-economic settings. Some diseases have global epidemic—or pandemic—potential, resulting in dramatic action from international organizations and national agricultural—and health authorities in most countries, for instance as was the case with avian influenza. Other diseases relate to the industrialized food production chain and have been—in some settings—dealt with efficiently through farm-to-fork preventive action in the animal sector, e.g. Salmonella. Finally, an important group of zoonotic diseases are ‘neglected diseases’ in poor settings, while they have been basically eradicated in affluent economies through vaccination and culling policies in the animal sector, e.g. Brucella.",2012-07-05,"Wielinga, Peter R.; Schlundt, Jørgen",One Health: The Human-Animal-Environment Interfaces in Emerging Infectious Diseases,,document_parses/pdf_json/efb0a2428e01166c9d260429eb2c6a220356dba2.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121890/,,2012,401

The aim of this study was to identify key genes, microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) and construct a miRNA–mRNA–TF regulatory networks to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism in periodontitis. METHODS: The GSE54710 miRNA microarray dataset and the gene expression microarray dataset GSE16134 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMis) and mRNAs (DEMs) were screened using the “limma” package in R. The intersection of the target genes of candidate DEMis and DEMs were considered significant DEMs in the regulatory network. Next, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted. Subsequently, DEMs were uploaded to the STRING database, a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was established, and the cytoHubba and MCODE plugins were used to screen out key hub mRNAs and significant modules. Ultimately, to investigate the regulatory network underlying periodontitis, a global triple network including miRNAs, mRNAs, and TFs was constructed using Cytoscape software. RESULTS: 8 DEMis and 121 DEMs were found between the periodontal and control groups. GO analysis showed that mRNAs were most significantly enriched in positive regulation of the cell cycle, and KEGG pathway analysis showed that mRNAs in the regulatory network were mainly involved in the IL-17 signalling pathway. A PPI network was constructed including 81 nodes and 414 edges. Furthermore, 12 hub genes ranked by the top 10% genes with high degree connectivity and five TFs, including SRF, CNOT4, SIX6, SRRM3, NELFA, and ONECUT3, were identified and might play crucial roles in the molecular pathogenesis of periodontitis. Additionally, a miRNA–mRNA–TF coregulatory network was established. CONCLUSION: In this study, we performed an integrated analysis based on public databases to identify specific TFs, miRNAs, and mRNAs that may play a pivotal role in periodontitis. On this basis, a TF–miRNA–mRNA network was established to provide a comprehensive perspective of the regulatory mechanism networks of periodontitis.

L’impact du confinement sur les comportements alimentaires ou la santé mentale a fait l’objet d’étude mais à notre connaissance l’impact sur l’état cutané n’a jamais été étudié. Matériel et méthodes Nous avons constitué un échantillon représentatif de la population générale adulte (n = 6050 ; 49,3 % d’hommes), de 3 pays (Brésil, n = 2000 ; États-Unis, n = 2050 ; France, n = 2000) d’avril à mai 2020. Les participants étaient invités à remplir un questionnaire numérique structuré. Nous nous sommes intéressés aux données sociodémographiques, à la sensibilité déclarée de leur peau, aux modifications observées durant le confinement (sécheresse cutanée, éruption, rougeur, prurit) Résultats Soixante-dix-sept pour cent (n = 4657) des répondeurs déclaraient avoir subi un confinement : 82 % (n = 1640) en France, 85 % (n = 1706) au Brésil, et 64 % (n = 1311) aux États-Unis. Parmi eux, 22 % (n = 1011) déclaraient avoir observé une modification de leur peau du fait du confinement : 17 % (n = 287) des Français, 28 % (n = 477, p <0,00001) des Brésiliens et 19 % (n = 247, NS) des Américains. Les femmes rapportaient plus souvent une modification de leur peau (26 % vs 17 %, p <0,00001). Les trois symptômes principaux : une peau plus sèche (46 %), une éruption cutanée (31 %) et un prurit (27 %). Déclaraient avoir noté une peau plus sèche (Fr, Br, EU) : 47 % (n = 137), 47 % (n = 224, NS), 44 % (n =109, NS). Déclaraient avoir noté une éruption cutanée (Fr, Br, EU) : 30 % (n = 87), 31 % (n = 149, NS), 32 % (n = 180, NS). Déclaraient avoir plus de démangeaisons sur la peau (Fr, Br, EU) : 22 % (n = 63), 25 % (n = 118, NS), 31 % (n = 78, p = 0,014). Les femmes rapportaient plus souvent une peau plus sèche liée au confinement (50,5 % vs 39,6 %, p = 0,0009). Les patients avec une peau dite sensible étaient plus à même de rapporter des modifications cutanées lors du confinement (29 % vs 15 %, p <0,00001) globalement et dans les 3 pays. Discussion Notre étude montre que le confinement s’accompagne de modifications cutanées subjectives et objectives, qu’il affecte le plus souvent les femmes, et les personnes rapportant une peau sensible. On peut extrapoler que ce sont près de 7 millions de Français, 32 millions d’Américains et 33 millions de Brésiliens qui sont concernés. La sécheresse de la peau peut être attribuée à une utilisation plus fréquente de savon et ou de solutions hydro-alcooliques, l’exacerbation du prurit et les éruptions cutanées ne sont pas négligeables. On ne peut éliminer une exacerbation de dermatoses chroniques due au stress et au confinement, ainsi qu’aux variations climatiques saisonnières. Les limitations de notre étude incluent le caractère déclaratif des réponses.

We compared the impact of the Delta variant and non-Delta variant on the COVID-19 outcomes in patients from Yogyakarta and Central Java provinces, Indonesia. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we ascertained 161 patients, 69 with the Delta variant and 92 with the non-Delta variant. The Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencer was used to perform the whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2. Results: The mean age of patients with the Delta variant and the non-Delta variant was 27.3 ± 20.0 and 43.0 ± 20.9 (p = 3 × 10(−6)). The patients with Delta variant consisted of 23 males and 46 females, while the patients with the non-Delta variant involved 56 males and 36 females (p = 0.001). The Ct value of the Delta variant (18.4 ± 2.9) was significantly lower than that of the non-Delta variant (19.5 ± 3.8) (p = 0.043). There was no significant difference in the hospitalization and mortality of patients with Delta and non-Delta variants (p = 0.80 and 0.29, respectively). None of the prognostic factors were associated with the hospitalization, except diabetes with an OR of 3.6 (95% CI = 1.02–12.5; p = 0.036). Moreover, the patients with the following factors have been associated with higher mortality rate than the patients without the factors: age ≥65 years, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease with the OR of 11 (95% CI = 3.4–36; p = 8 × 10(−5)), 27 (95% CI = 6.1–118; p = 1 × 10(−5)), 15.6 (95% CI = 5.3–46; p = 6 × 10(−7)), 12 (95% CI = 4–35.3; p = 1.2 × 10(−5)), and 6.8 (95% CI = 2.1–22.1; p = 0.003), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that age ≥65 years, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension were the strong prognostic factors for the mortality of COVID-19 patients with the OR of 3.6 (95% CI = 0.58–21.9; p = 0.028), 16.6 (95% CI = 2.5–107.1; p = 0.003), 5.5 (95% CI = 1.3–23.7; p = 0.021), and 5.8 (95% CI = 1.02–32.8; p = 0.047), respectively. Conclusions: We show that the patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant have a lower Ct value than the patients infected by the non-Delta variant, implying that the Delta variant has a higher viral load, which might cause a more transmissible virus among humans. However, the Delta variant does not affect the COVID-19 outcomes in our patients.

This paper focuses on the relationship between the COVID-19 threat and variety-seeking. Based on several theories, including reactance theory and terror management theory, we predict that the perceived threat of COVID-19 will increase the tendency to choose more and different options in multiple choice settings. Firstly, two empirical studies demonstrate that variety-seeking in food and stationery choices is enhanced as people's perceived threat from the disease increases. Study 3 further suggests the boundary conditions of the above pattern in that the type of decision (i.e., multiple option selections across different brands vs. within the same brand) will moderate the impact of the perceived threat on varietyseeking. Specifically, when the decision involved choice across different brands, participants showed higher variety-seeking under high (vs. low) perceived threat. However, the opposite pattern was true when the decision involved choice within the same brand. This research offers a deeper understanding of how variety-seeking can be changed by the perceived threat of COVID-19.",2020-07-07,"Kim, Jungkeun",,,document_parses/pdf_json/0241a3a129ac32b0df1461fa387854e86faa96de.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1441358220300653; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1441358220300653?v=s5,220383700.0,2020,176

The research and medical communities are increasingly considering ways of reducing stigma, and health professionals have a role to play in normalising abortion as part of routine sexual and reproductive healthcare (SRH). We sought to investigate how health professionals may normalise abortion and challenge prevailing negative sociocultural narratives. METHODS As part of the Sexuality and Abortion Stigma Study (SASS), qualitative secondary analysis was conducted on two datasets containing health professionals' accounts of providing abortion in Scotland and England. A subsample of 20 interviews were subjected to in-depth, thematic analysis. RESULTS Four key themes were identified in heath professionals' accounts: (1) encountering resistance to abortion from others working in SRH; (2) contending with prevailing negative sociocultural narratives of abortion; (3) enacting overt positivity towards abortion provision; and (4) presenting abortion as part of normal, routine healthcare. CONCLUSIONS It is clear that negative attitudes toward abortion persist both inside and outside of healthcare systems, and need to be challenged in order to destigmatise those accessing and providing services. Health professionals can play a key role in normalising abortion, through the ways in which they frame their work and present abortion to women they treat, and others more widely. Our analysis suggests a key way to achieve this is by presenting abortion as part of normal, routine SRH, but that appropriate support and structural change are essential for normalisation to become embedded.",2020-04-02,"Maxwell, Karen J; Hoggart, Lesley; Bloomer, Fiona; Rowlands, Sam; Purcell, Carrie",BMJ sexual & reproductive health,,,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2019-200480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32241826/,214769032.0,2020,242

These missing or incomplete features can affect and limit the application of quantitative methods in pharmacovigilance for meta-analyses of data during randomized clinical trials. METHODS: Data from patients with hypertension were retrieved and integrated from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System; 134 antihypertensive drugs out of 1131 drugs were filtered and then evaluated using the empirical Bayes geometric mean (EBGM) of the posterior distribution to build ADE-drug profiles with an emphasis on the pulmonary ADEs. Afterward, the graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GLASSO) captured drug associations based on pulmonary ADEs by correcting hidden factors and confounder misclassification. Selected drugs were then compared using the Friedman test in drug classes and clusters obtained from GLASSO. RESULTS: Following multiple filtering stages to exclude insignificant and noise-driven reports, we found that drugs from antihypertensives agents, urologicals, and antithrombotic agents (macitentan, bosentan, epoprostenol, selexipag, sildenafil, tadalafil, and beraprost) form a similar class with a significantly higher incidence of pulmonary ADEs. Macitentan and bosentan were associated with 64% and 56% of pulmonary ADEs, respectively. Because these two medications are prescribed in diseases affecting pulmonary function and may be likely to emerge among the highest reported pulmonary ADEs, in fact, they serve to validate the methods utilized here. Conversely, doxazosin and rilmenidine were found to have the least pulmonary ADEs in selected drugs from hypertension patients. Nifedipine and candesartan were also found by signal detection methods to form a drug cluster, shown by several studies an effective combination of these drugs on lowering blood pressure and appeared an improved side effect profile in comparison with single-agent monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: We consider pulmonary ADE profiles in multiple long-standing groups of therapeutics including antihypertensive agents, antithrombotic agents, beta-blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, or agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system, in patients with hypertension associated with high risk for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We found that several individual drugs have significant differences between their drug classes and compared to other drug classes. For instance, macitentan and bosentan from endothelin receptor antagonists show major concern while doxazosin and rilmenidine exhibited the least pulmonary ADEs compared to the outcomes of other drugs. Using techniques in this study, we assessed and confirmed the hypothesis that drugs from the same drug class could have very different pulmonary ADE profiles affecting outcomes in acute respiratory illness.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the incidence of VTE in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched up to 24th June 2020 for studies that evaluated the incidence of VTE, including pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), in patients with COVID-19. Pooled proportions with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) and prediction intervals (PI) were calculated by random-effect meta-analysis. RESULTS: 3487 patients from 30 studies were included. Based on very low-quality evidence due to heterogeneity and risk of bias, the incidence of VTE was 26% (95% PI, 6%–66%). PE with or without DVT occurred in 12% of patients (95% PI, 2%–46%) and DVT alone in 14% (95% PI, 1%–75%). Studies using standard algorithms for clinically suspected VTE reported PE in 13% of patients (95% PI, 2%–57%) and DVT in 6% (95% PI, 0%–60%), compared to 11% (95% PI, 2%–46%) and 24% (95% PI, 2%–85%) in studies using other diagnostic strategies or patient sampling. In patients admitted to intensive care units, VTE occurred in 24% (95% PI, 5%–66%), PE in 19% (95% PI, 6%–47%), and DVT alone in 7% (95% PI, 0%–69%). Corresponding values in general wards were respectively 9% (95% PI, 0%–94%), 4% (95% PI, 0%–100%), and 7% (95% CI, 1%–49%).

However, the diagnosis and implementation of these processes requires broad consensus from all stakeholders and the ability to fit them into urban planning in such a way that it allows the proposals to become realistic actions. In this study, a review of the sustainable urban mobility plans of 47 cities in Spain during the last 15 years has been carried out, analyzing both the diagnosis and proposal of solutions and their subsequent implementation. From the results obtained, a new framework based on a structured hybrid methodology is proposed to aid decision-making for the evaluation of alternatives in the implementation of proposals in SUMP. This hybrid methodology considers experts’ and stakeholders’ opinion and applies two different multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods in different phases to present two rankings of best alternatives. From that experience, an analysis based on the MCDM methods called ‘Sequential Interactive Modelling for Urban Systems (SIMUS)’ and weighted sum method (WSM) was applied to a case study of the city of Cartagena, a southeastern middle-size city in Spain. This analytic proposal has been transferred to the practical field in the SUMP of Cartagena, the first instrument of this nature developed after COVID-19 in Spain for a relevant city.

METHODS: We describe a nonparametric statistical method, originally applied to the reporting of AIDS cases in the 1980s, to estimate the distribution of reporting delays of confirmed COVID-19 cases in New York City during the late summer and early fall of 2020. RESULTS: During August 15–September 26, the estimated mean delay in reporting was 3.3 days, with 87% of cases reported by 5 days from diagnosis. Relying upon the estimated reporting-delay distribution, we projected COVID-19 incidence during the most recent 3 weeks as if each case had instead been reported on the same day that the underlying diagnostic test had been performed. Applying our delay-corrected estimates to case counts reported as of September 26, we projected a surge in new diagnoses that had already occurred but had yet to be reported. Our projections were consistent with counts of confirmed cases subsequently reported by November 7. CONCLUSION: The projected estimate of recently diagnosed cases could have had an impact on timely policy decisions to tighten social distancing measures. While the recent advent of widespread rapid antigen testing has changed the diagnostic testing landscape considerably, delays in public reporting of SARS-CoV-2 case counts remain an important barrier to effective public health policy.

In vitro expanded and differentiated primary HAE cells collected from patients seem to be an accurate model of human airway, offering a quicker and cheaper alternative to the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) models. However, the biggest drawback of primary HAE models is their limited proliferative lifespan in culture. Much work has been devoted to understand the factors, which govern the HAE cell proliferation and differentiation, both in vivo and in vitro. Here, I have summarized recent achievements in primary HAE culture, with the special emphasis on the models of conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRC), which allow longer in vitro proliferation and differentiation of HAE cells. The review compares the CRC HAE technique variants (feeder culture or HAE mono-culture), based on recently published studies exploiting this model. The advantages and limitations of each CRC HAE model variant are summarized, along with the description of other factors affecting the CRC HAE culture success (tissue type, sampling method, sample quality). CONCLUSIONS: CRC HAE cultures are a useful technique in respiratory research, which in many cases exceeds the iPSCs and organoid culture methods. Until the current limitations of the iPSCs and organoid culture methods will be alleviated, the primary CRC HAE cultures might be a useful model in respiratory research. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY: Airway epithelium (AE) is a type of tissue, which lines the whole length of human airways, from the nose to the bronchi. Improper functioning of AE causes several human airway disorders, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis (CF). Much work has been devoted to finding the best scientific model of human AE, in order to learn about its functioning in health and disease. Among the popular AE models are the primary in vitro cultured AE cells collected from human donors. Unfortunately, such human AE (HAE) cells do not easily divide (expand) in vitro; this poses a large logistic and ethical problem for the researchers. Here, I summarize recent achievements in the methods for in vitro culture of human AE cells, with special emphasis on the conditionally reprogrammed cell (CRC) models, which allow longer and more effective expansion of primary human AE cells in vitro. The review describes how the specific chemicals used in the CRC models work to allow the increased HAE divisions and compares the effects of the different so-far developed variants of the CRC HAE culture. The review also pinpoints the areas which need to be refined, in order to maximize the usefulness of the CRC AE cultures from human donors in research on human airway disorders.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed the effectiveness of a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine against any SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) and severe COVID-19 (hospitalization or death) after over two months from administration among priority target groups (n = 18,524,568) during predominant circulation of the Delta variant in Italy (July–December 2021). RESULTS: Vaccine effectiveness (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection and, to a lesser extent, against severe COVID-19, among people ≥60 years and other high-risk groups (i.e. healthcare workers, residents in long-term-care facilities, and persons with comorbidities or immunocompromised), peaked in the time-interval 3–13 weeks (VE against infection = 67.2%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 62.5–71.3; VE against severe disease = 89.5%, 95% CI: 86.1–92.0) and then declined, waning 26 weeks after full primary vaccination (VE against infection = 12.2%, 95% CI: −4.7–26.4; VE against severe disease = 65.3%, 95% CI: 50.3–75.8).

The purpose of this study was to assess the surface electromyographic (EMG) activity of the lumbar extensor muscles during dynamic exercise on a home back extension exercise device. Ten adults (5 F, 5 M) performed dynamic lumbar extension exercise on a home device at three loads: 1.00 × body weight (BW), 1.25 × BW and 1.50 × BW. Surface EMG activity from the L3/4 paraspinal region was collected. The effect of exercise load, phase of movement, and position in the range of motion on lumbar extensor EMG activity (normalized to % maximum voluntary isometric contraction) was assessed. Lumbar extensor EMG activity significantly increased from 1.00 BW to 1.50 BW loads (p = 0.0006), eccentric to concentric phases (p < 0.0001), and flexion to extension positions (p < 0.0001).

A cross-sectional phase in this study will gather more evidence concerning this topic. A longitudinal phase will explore the efficacy of a biofeedback intervention based on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in adolescents with ASD. Finally, a feasibility study will focus on a non-supervised RSA biofeedback intervention in this population. METHODS: The cross-sectional phase includes the comparison of adolescents with ASD (n=38) and age- and gender-matched typically developing peers. A standardized assessment will be used which contains physiological, cortisol, and behavioral measurements. The longitudinal phase contains a randomized, single-blinded, and sham-controlled design to determine the efficacy of supervised RSA biofeedback in adolescents with ASD (n=128). A follow-up phase of 5 weeks is included to evaluate the presence of retention effects. During the latter, a feasibility study will focus on a non-supervised intervention (n=64). Assessments as described previously are scheduled after the intervention and the follow-up phase. DISCUSSION: First, more conclusive evidence will be provided for the presence of lower cardiac vagal modulation in adolescents with ASD as well as the association between these lower values and physiological and behavioral indices. Second, the supervised intervention in adolescents with ASD is hypothesized to upregulate this cardiac vagal modulation and positively change behavioral and physiological parameters. Third, evidence regarding the feasibility and acceptability of a non-supervised intervention may open novel avenues for home-based interventions in this population.

We performed a cross-sectional study of ALD at our liver transplantation (LT) center, located in the initial U.S. epicenter, New York City (NYC). Results Centered around the ""stay at home"" order date in NY state, 3/22/20, we defined 3 time periods: ""pre-COVID"" (1/1/20-3/21/20); ""COVID-quarantine"" (3/22/20-4/22/20); and ""declining-COVID"" (4/23/20-8/25/20).We found a 62% increase in interhospital patient transfers for ALD from pre-COVID (20/93, 21%) to the declining-COVID period (43/127, 34%). Our inpatient liver census with ALD also increased: 38% pre-COVID, 45% COVID-quarantine and 49% declining-COVID.Among 30 severe AH patients not responding to medical therapy since 3/22/20, 9 underwent early LT for AH (16% of the total number of early LT during our 8-year program). Three of 9 early LT recipients reported specific COVID-related stressors.All 25 previous LT recipients with established abstinence pre-COVID maintained abstinence at follow-up visits during declining-COVID period. Of 6 recipients with sustained alcohol use within 6 months before 3/22/20, half regained abstinence during the declining-COVID period. Conclusion Our findings help confirm the predictions of rising AUD and ALD as an immediate consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. This aftershock particularly affected ethnically diverse ALD patients with high inpatient mortality, reflecting the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on underserved and minority populations.Alcohol relapse did not occur in long-term early LT for AH recipients during the time of COVID-19.

Although the virus usually first invades and infects the lung and respiratory track tissue, in extreme cases, almost all major organs in the body are now known to be negatively impacted often leading to severe systemic failure in some people. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective treatment for this disease. Pre-existing pathological conditions or comorbidities such as age are a major reason for premature death and increased morbidity and mortality. The immobilization due to hospitalization and bed rest and the physical inactivity due to sustained quarantine and social distancing can downregulate the ability of organs systems to resist to viral infection and increase the risk of damage to the immune, respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal systems and the brain. The cellular mechanisms and danger of this “second wave” effect of COVID-19 to the human body, along with the effects of aging, proper nutrition, and regular physical activity, are reviewed in this editorial article.",2020-05-30,"Woods, Jeffrey; Hutchinson, Noah T.; Powers, Scott K.; Roberts, William O.; Gomez-Cabrera, M.

Double helices with consecutive Watson-Crick base-pairing may also be formed between distant RNA segments thereby facilitating long-range interactions of long-chain RNA that may be biologically functional. Here we addressed the potential formation of RNA duplex motifs by long-range RNA-RNA interactions of distantly located matching sequence elements of a single long-chain RNA. RESULTS: We generated a Python-based software tool that identifies consecutive RNA duplex elements at any given length and nucleotide content formed by distant sequences. The software tool, dubbed RNAslider, is built on the theoretical RNA structure prediction algorithm Mfold. Source code and sample data sets are available on demand. We found that a small ratio of human genes including the Argonaute (Ago)-like gene family encode mRNAs containing highly GC-rich non-hairpin duplex elements (GC-helix) of equal to or more than 8 base pairs in length and we provide experimental evidence for their biological significance. CONCLUSION: GC-helices are observed preferentially within the 5(′)-region of mRNAs in an evolutionarily conserved fashion indicating their potential biological role.

Educators approached curriculum design seeking to replicate as much of the in-person experience as possible and were faced with overcoming the challenges of replacing the innately hands-on nature of surgery with virtual operative and skills experiences. Restrictions on in-person visiting electives expedited the role of virtual education as a notable opportunity for medical student education and recruitment, with a variety of approaches to engaging undergraduate medical learners including the use of live-streaming operative cases, virtual didactic curricula and a rise in podcasts, web-based conferences, and virtual journal clubs. In addition to education, virtual outreach to medical students has become an essential tool in trainee recruitment and selection, and ongoing application of novel educational platforms will allow for new opportunities in multi-institutional collaboration and exchange with a multitude of benefits to future vascular surgery trainees.

They result either from chromosomal rearrangements or from splicing mechanisms that are non-chromosomal rearrangements. Chromosomal rearrangements that result in gene fusions are particularly prevalent in sarcomas and hematopoietic malignancies; they are also common in solid tumors. The splicing process can also give rise to more complex RNA patterns in cells. Gene fusions frequently affect tyrosine kinases, chromatin regulators, or transcription factors, and can cause constitutive activation, enhancement of downstream signaling, and tumor development, as major drivers of oncogenesis. In addition, some fusion RNAs have been shown to function as noncoding RNAs and to affect cancer progression. Fusion genes and RNAs will therefore become increasingly important as diagnostic and therapeutic targets for cancer development. Here, we discuss the function, biogenesis, detection, clinical relevance, and therapeutic implications of oncogenic fusion genes and RNAs in cancer development.

It has impacted neurologists and other health care workers, not only in our professional lives but also through the fear and panic within our own families, colleagues, patients and their families, and even in the wider public. COVID-19 affects all sorts of individuals, but the elderly with underlying chronic conditions are particularly at risk of severe disease, or even death. Parkinson’s disease (PD) shares a common profile as an age-dependent degenerative disorder, frequently associated with comorbidities, particularly cardiovascular diseases, so PD patients will almost certainly fall into the high-risk group. Therefore, the aim of this review is to explore the risk of COVID-19 in PD based on the susceptibility to severe disease, its impact on PD disease severity, potential long-term sequelae, and difficulties of PD management during this outbreak, where neurologists face various challenges on how we can maintain effective care for PD patients without exposing them, or ourselves, to the risk of infection. It is less than six months since the identification of the original COVID-19 case on New Year’s Eve 2019, so it is still too early to fully understand the natural history of COVID-19 and the evidence on COVID-19-related PD is scant.

In MCS systems, a crowd supplies sensing information for monitoring phenomena through mobile devices. Depending on the degree of involvement of users, MCS systems can be participatory, opportunistic or hybrid, which combines strengths of above approaches. Typically, a large number of participants is required to make a sensing campaign successful which makes impractical to build and deploy large testbeds to assess the performance of MCS phases like data collection, user recruitment, and evaluating the quality of information. Simulations offer a valid alternative. In this paper, we focus on hybrid MCS and extend CrowdSenSim 2.0 in order to support such systems. Specifically, we propose an algorithm for efficient re-route users that would offer opportunistic contribution towards the location of sensitive MCS tasks that require participatory-type of sensing contribution.

The objective of this study was to review surgical outcomes of MD and evaluate the feasibility of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in MD. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of the medical records of patients who underwent diverticulectomy for MD at 6 Hallym University-affiliated hospitals between January 2008 and December 2017. All patients underwent either open surgery or MIS. Patients who underwent MIS were subdivided into laparoscopic only diverticulectomy (LOD) or laparoscopic-assisted diverticulectomy (LAD). Results Of 64 patients, 21 underwent open surgery and 43 underwent MIS. Time to flatus, time to soft food intake, and length of hospital stay were shorter in the MIS group than in the open surgery group (P = 0.047, P = 0.005, and P = 0.015, respectively). Among patients who underwent MIS, the time to flatus and time to soft food intake were longer in the LAD group than in the LOD group (0.3 and 0.9 days, respectively). Multivariate analysis showed that old age and preoperative ileus were independent predictors of complications (P = 0.030 and P = 0.013, respectively).

Data are limited on the association between a prolonged viral shedding in patients with COVID-19 and having symptoms. We aimed to study the association between the presence of symptoms and recovery time of COVID-19 confirmed patients. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted to the designated national COVID-19 center in Monastir, Tunisia from March to July 2020. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess viral shedding in asymptomatic versus symptomatic patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Among the 264 patients included in the study, symptoms such as anosmia, dry cough, and fatigue were reported by 34.4% (n = 75) of cases. The median time to RNA viral conversion was 24 days (IQR 18-36 days) for symptomatic patients versus 20 days (IQR 16-30 days) for asymptomatic patients. Having symptoms was significantly associated with a prolonged viral shedding (HR 0.600, 95% CI 0.401-0.897) (p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that having symptoms delayed viral clearance among COVID-19 patients. Therefore, symptomatology should be taken into consideration in isolation strategy for infected patients. KEY MESSAGES: Having symptoms was associated with a delay in SARS-CoV-2 RNA clearance.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the added benefit of Cyclosporine‐A (CsA), to low‐dose steroid treatment, in patients with COVID‐19. METHODS: Open‐label, non‐randomized pilot study of patients with confirmed infection of SARS‐CoV2, hospitalized from April to May 2020 at a single center in Puebla, Mexico. Comparative treatment with steroids or CsA plus steroids. Pneumonia severity was assessed by clinical, laboratory, and lung tomography. The death rate was evaluated at 28 days. RESULTS: 209 adult patients were studied, 105 received CsA plus steroids (age 55.3 ±13.3; 69% men), and 104 steroids alone (age 54.06 ±13.8; 61% men). All patients received clarithromycin, enoxaparin, and methylprednisolone or prednisone up to 10 days. Patient´s death was associated with hypertension (RR=3.5) and diabetes (RR=2.3). Mortality was 22 and 35% for CsA and control groups (p=0.02), respectively, for all patients, and 24 and 48.5% for patients with moderate to severe disease (p=0.001). Higher cumulative clinical improvement was seen for the CsA group (Nelson Aalen curve, p=0.001, log‐rank test) in moderate to severe patients. The Cox proportional hazard analysis showed the highest HR improvement value of 2.15 (1.39‐3.34, 95%CI, p=0.0005) for CsA treatment in moderate to severe patients, and HR = 1.95 (1.35‐2.83, 95%CI, p=0.0003) for all patients.

In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antiviral, strategies for mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation and the use of face-masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of these mitigation strategies. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission in New York state and the entire US, show that the pandemic will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) in New York State and the entire US decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%, respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. This study shows that early termination of strict social-distancing could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to that projected before the onset of strict social-distance. The use of efficacious face-masks (efficacy greater than 70%) could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of other anti-COVID-19 intervention measures can lead to elimination of the pandemic. The mask coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if mask-use is combined with strict social-distancing.",2020-04-15,"Ngonghala, Calistus N.; Iboi, Enahoro; Eikenberry, Steffen; Scotch, Matthew; MacIntyre, Chandini Raina; Bonds, Matthew H.; Gumel, Abba B.",,,document_parses/pdf_json/b9ed2c83d4226ff4c53759324071adff7f264254.json,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07391v2.pdf,215786294.0,2020,289

To comply with this constraint, workplaces, public institutions, transports and schools will likely adopt restrictions over the minimum inter-personal distance between people. Given this actual scenario, it is crucial to massively measure the compliance to such physical constraint in our life, in order to figure out the reasons of the possible breaks of such distance limitations, and understand if this implies a possible threat given the scene context. All of this, complying with privacy policies and making the measurement acceptable. To this end, we introduce the Visual Social Distancing (VSD) problem, defined as the automatic estimation of the inter-personal distance from an image, and the characterization of the related people aggregations. VSD is pivotal for a non-invasive analysis to whether people comply with the SD restriction, and to provide statistics about the level of safety of specific areas whenever this constraint is violated. We then discuss how VSD relates with previous literature in Social Signal Processing and indicate which existing Computer Vision methods can be used to manage such problem.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S protein directly interacts with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell membrane. In this study, we used computational saturation mutagenesis approaches, including structure-based energy calculations and sequence-based pathogenicity predictions, to quantify the systemic effects of missense mutations on SARS-CoV-2 S protein structure and function. A total of 18 354 mutations in S protein were analyzed, and we discovered that most of these mutations could destabilize the entire S protein and its RBD. Specifically, residues G431 and S514 in SARS-CoV-2 RBD are important for S protein stability. We analyzed 384 experimentally verified S missense variations and revealed that the dominant pandemic form, D614G, can stabilize the entire S protein. Moreover, many mutations in N-linked glycosylation sites can increase the stability of the S protein. In addition, we investigated 3705 mutations in SARS-CoV-2 RBD and 11 324 mutations in human ACE2 and found that SARS-CoV-2 neighbor residues G496 and F497 and ACE2 residues D355 and Y41 are critical for the RBD–ACE2 interaction.

However, despite substantial overlap in populations who request MAiD and who require palliative care (PC) services, policies and recommended practices regarding the optimal relationship between MAiD and PC services are not well developed. Multiple models are possible, including autonomous delivery of these services and formal or informal coordination, collaboration or integration. However, it is not clear which of these approaches are most appropriate, feasible or acceptable in different Canadian health settings in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the post-pandemic period. The aim of this qualitative study is to understand the attitudes and opinions of key stakeholders from the government, health system, patient groups and academia in Canada regarding the optimal relationship between MAiD and PC services. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A qualitative, purposeful sampling approach will elicit stakeholder feedback of 25–30 participants using semistructured interviews. Stakeholders with expertise and engagement in MAiD or PC who hold leadership positions in their respective organisations across Canada will be invited to provide their perspectives on the relationship between MAiD and PC; capacity-building needs; policy development opportunities; and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the relationship between MAiD and PC services. Transcripts will be analysed using content analysis. A framework for integrated health services will be used to assess the impact of integrating services on multiple levels.

All IFIT proteins contain multiple TPR motifs which mediate protein-protein interactions. Some, but not all, members inhibit initiation of protein synthesis by binding to the translation initiation factor eIF-3 or by binding to the 5′ end of the mRNA. The murine Ifit1 encodes P56, Ifit2 encodes P54 and Ifit3 encodes P49. For investigating the biological functions of the murine Ifit proteins, we have recently generated several knock-out mice. Challenging Ifit1-/- and Ifit2-/- mice with various viruses have revealed their strong, but selective, antiviral properties. Ifit1-mediated host restriction was shown to be evaded by 2′-O-methylation of viral mRNAs. Flavivirus (West Nile Virus), vaccinia virus and coronavirus mutants, that lack 2′-O-methylation of their mRNAs, were growth-restricted in Wt, but not in Ifit1-/-, cells and mice. Further studies revealed that the action of Ifit1 on WNV replication is highly manifested in CNS infection, a deficiency of Ifit1 causing increased neuronal death in infected mice. Ifit2, on the other hand, blocked neuro-pathogenesis caused by intranasal infection with the rhabdovirus, VSV. All Ifit proteins were induced in the CNS of the infected mice, but Ifit1-/- mice were not more susceptible than Wt mice and most of the infected mice survived. In contrast, all Ifit2-/- mice died from neuro-pathogenesis; VSV replicated efficiently in the neurons of these mice. However, there was no effect on pathogenesis by another neuro-tropic virus, EMCV. Moreover, VSV did not replicate efficiently in the liver or the lung of infected Ifit2-/- mice and in vitro, in MEF or primary fetal neurons, the sensitivity of VSV replication to IFN-treatment was similar in Wt and Ifit2-/- cells.

The consequences of using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) during the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study aiming to identify the odds of severe disease (defined as either hospitalization of ≥14 days, admission to the intensive care unit, or death) associated with exposure to ACEi or ARB was conducted. Adult patients (age ≥18 years) with COVID-19 admitted to the İstanbul Faculty of Medicine Corona Center between March 9 and May 11, 2020, were included. Chronic users of ACEi, ARB, or other antihypertensive drugs were matched according to age, sex, sick days before hospitalization, comorbidities, smoking, number of antihypertensive regimens, doxazosin use, furosemide use, and serum creatinine level. Odds ratios (OR) of having severe disease were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 611 patients were admitted with COVID-19, confirmed by either reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or computed tomography (CT). There were 363 males, and the age ranged from 18 to 98 years, with an average age of 57±15 years. Of these, 165 participants had severe disease (53 deaths, case fatality rate: 8.7%). Among those with hypertension (n=249), ARB exposure was compatible with decreased odds (OR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.27–1.36, p=0.31) of severe disease though not statistically significant, while ACEi exposure significantly reduced the risk of severe disease (OR=0.37, 95% CI: 0.15–0.87, p=0.03). ACEi exposure was associated with milder infiltrations seen on baseline CT, lower C-reactive protein and ferritin, higher monocytes, shorter hospitalization, and less requirement for specific empirical treatments (favipiravir and meropenem).

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationships among household chaos, maternal stress, and maternal physical activity and sleep, and identify barriers to home organization during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using an online survey of 1721 mothers of preschoolers (ages = 3.0–5.9 years) in the United States was conducted in May 2020 during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders and early reopening. Mothers reported demographic characteristics, household chaos, stress, physical activity and sleep, and barriers to home organization during the outbreak. Mediation models were conducted among household chaos, stress, and physical activity and sleep with adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: About half of mothers were middle income (48.2%), employed full-time prior to the outbreak (59.1%), and met the physical activity (47.7%), and sleep guideline (49.7%, 7–9 h/day). Household chaos and stress were both negatively related to physical activity and sleep. For every 1 unit increase in mother’s current stress, mothers were 11% (95% confidence interval = 6% to 16%) less likely to meet the physical activity guideline and 19% (95% confidence interval = 14% to 23%) less likely to meet the sleep guideline. Household chaos was positively related to stress. Stress partially mediated the relationship between household chaos and physical activity and sleep. Virus concerns, occupational changes (i.e. teleworking), and lack of childcare were barriers to home organization. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 outbreak, many mothers had poor sleep and physical activity, which was associated with household chaos and stress. Opportunities to promote order at the individual, household, and community level may result in beneficial mental and physical health in mothers of young children during the COVID-19 outbreak and beyond.",2021-04-22,"Kracht, Chelsea L; Katzmarzyk, Peter T; Staiano, Amanda E",Womens Health (Lond),,document_parses/pdf_json/81eb7dfb63ebbc054c4d8d9d8dd16ff7c9344458.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886392/; https://doi.org/10.1177/17455065211010655,233370868.0,2021,307

To achieve high-level expression of recombinant PCV3 Cap in Escherichia coli (E. coli), the gene of wild-type entire Cap (wt-eCap) was amplified from clinical samples, and three optimized entire Cap (opti-eCap) and one optimized Cap deleted nuclear location signal (NLS) (opti-dCap) gene fragments encoding the same amino acid sequence with wt-eCap were synthesized based on the codon bias of E. coli. Those gene fragments were inserted into the pET30a expression vector. One recombinant strain with the highest expressed soluble eCap from four entire Cap (one wt-eCap and three opti-eCap) and one recombinant strain expressed opti-dCap were selected for further purification. The purified eCap and dCap were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), a large number of round hollow particles with a diameter of 10 nm virus-like particles (VLPs) were observed in eCap, whereas irregular aggregation of proteins observed in dCap. After formation the VLPs were applied as a coating antigen to establish an indirect ELISA (I-ELISA) for detection of PCV3-specific antibody in swine serum. 373 clinical swine serum samples from China collected in 2019 were tested utilizing the VLP-based I-ELISA method under optimized conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of self-assembly into VLPs of PCV3 recombinant Cap.

Emerging evidence has highlighted the potential importance of autoimmune activation in modulating the acute response and recovery trajectories following SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Given that immune-inflammatory activity can be sex-biased in the setting of severe COVID-19 illness, the aim of the study was to examine sex-specific autoimmune reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of extreme clinical disease. METHODS: In this study, we assessed autoantibody (AAB) reactivity to 91 autoantigens previously linked to a range of classic autoimmune diseases in a cohort of 177 participants (65% women, 35% men, mean age of 35) with confirmed evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection based on presence of antibody to the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2. Data were compared to 53 pre-pandemic healthy controls (49% women, 51% men). For each participant, socio-demographic data, serological analyses, SARS-CoV-2 infection status and COVID-19 related symptoms were collected by an electronic survey of questions. The symptoms burden score was constructed based on the total number of reported symptoms (N = 21) experienced within 6 months prior to the blood draw, wherein a greater number of symptoms corresponded to a higher score and assigned as more severe burden. RESULTS: In multivariable analyses, we observed sex-specific patterns of autoreactivity associated with the presence or absence (as well as timing and clustering of symptoms) associated with prior COVID-19 illness. Whereas the overall AAB response was more prominent in women following asymptomatic infection, the breadth and extent of AAB reactivity was more prominent in men following at least mildly symptomatic infection. Notably, the observed reactivity included distinct antigens with molecular homology with SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in the absence of severe clinical disease, can lead to a broad AAB response that exhibits sex-specific patterns of prevalence and antigen selectivity. Further understanding of the nature of triggered AAB activation among men and women exposed to SARS-CoV-2 will be essential for developing effective interventions against immune-mediated sequelae of COVID-19.

From September 2015 through August 2018, 203 NoV outbreaks involving 2500 cases were reported to the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention. METHODS: Faecal specimens for 203 outbreaks were collected and epidemiological data were obtained through the AGE outbreak surveillance system in Shenzhen. Genotypes were determined by sequencing analysis. To gain a better understanding of the evolutionary characteristics of NoV in Shenzhen, molecular evolution and mutations were evaluated based on time-scale evolutionary phylogeny and amino acid mutations. RESULTS: A total of nine districts reported NoV outbreaks and the reported NoV outbreaks peaked from November to March. Among the 203 NoV outbreaks, 150 were sequenced successfully. Most of these outbreaks were associated with the NoV GII.2[P16] strain (45.3%, 92/203) and occurred in school settings (91.6%, 186/203). The evolutionary rates of the RdRp region and the VP1 sequence were 2.1 × 10(–3) (95% HPD interval, 1.7 × 10(–3)–2.5 × 10(–3)) substitutions/site/year and 2.7 × 10(–3) (95% HPD interval, 2.4 × 10(–3)–3.1 × 10(–3)) substitutions/site/year, respectively. The common ancestors of the GII.2[P16] strain from Shenzhen and GII.4 Sydney 2012[P16] diverged from 2011 to 2012. The common ancestors of the GII.2[P16] strain from Shenzhen and previous GII.2[P16] (2010–2012) diverged from 2003 to 2004. The results of amino acid mutations showed 6 amino acid substitutions (*77E, R750K, P845Q, H1310Y, K1546Q, T1549A) were found only in GII.4 Sydney 2012[P16] and the GII.2[P16] recombinant strain. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the molecular epidemiological patterns in Shenzhen, China, from September 2015 to August 2018 and provides evidence that the epidemic trend of GII.2[P16] recombinant strain had weakened and the non-structural proteins of the recombinant strain might have played a more significant role than VP1.

Consequently, its dysregulation is associated with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Together, the ECS and the expanded endocannabinoidome (eCBome) are composed of genes coding for CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R, CB2R), endocannabinoids (eCBs), and the metabolic enzyme machinery for their synthesis and catabolism. The activation of CB1R is associated with adverse effects on the central nervous system (CNS), which has limited the therapeutic use of drugs that bind this receptor. The discovery of the functional neuronal CB2R raised new possibilities for the potential and safe targeting of the ECS for the treatment of CNS disorders. Previous studies were not able to detect CB2R mRNA transcripts in brain tissue and suggested that CB2Rs were absent in the brain and were considered peripheral receptors. Studies done on the role of CB2Rs as a potential therapeutic target for treating different disorders revealed the important putative role of CB2Rs in certain CNS disorders, which requires further clinical validation.

Total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) is a treatment option for patients with CP; however, predicting postoperative metabolic outcomes remains elusive. In this single-center retrospective study, we report pre-TPIAT characteristics, beta cell function indices, islet yield, and post-TPIAT glucose management data to further understand their relationship. Islet yield, glucose level, and insulin requirement for 72 hours postoperatively were collected for a total of 13 TPIAT recipients between 9-2013 and 9-2018. In addition, their glucose control and basal insulin requirements at 3, 6, and 12 months post-TPIAT were analyzed. All 13 subjects had normal baseline fasting glucose levels. Median islet yield was 4882 IEq/kg (interquartile range 3412 to 8987). Median postoperative total insulin requirement on day 3 was 0.43 units/kg. Pre-TPIAT baseline glucose, insulin, or c-peptide level did not have a significant correlation with the islet yield. Similarly, there was no correlation between islet yield and insulin requirement at 72-hour postoperatively. However, there was an inverse correlation between the absolute islet yield (IEq) and insulin requirement at 6 months and 12 months following post-TPIAT. Further analysis of the relationship between 72-hour post-op insulin requirement and insulin requirement at discharge, 3, 6, and 12 months showed a positive correlation. Despite the finding of inverse correlation of islet yield with long-term basal insulin requirement, this study was not able to detect a correlation between the preoperative parameters to postoperative short-term or long-term outcome as noted in other studies. The 72-hour postoperative insulin requirement is a helpful postoperative predictor of patients needing long-term insulin management following TPIAT.

Traditionally, patient glucose values are relayed by telephone for provider feedback, but digital health technology can now enable the remote sharing of glucose data via mobile apps. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of remote glucose monitoring in a population of children and adolescents with newly diagnosed T1D and to explore whether remote monitoring alters habits for self-review of glucose data or perceived ease of provider contact in this population as compared to a nonrandomized control group. METHODS: Data were collected from families who chose to participate in remote monitoring (intervention group) as well as from patients receiving usual care (control group). The intervention group received Bluetooth-capable glucose meters and Apple iPod Touch devices. Patient-generated glucose data were passively relayed from the meter to the iPod Touch and then to both the electronic health record (EHR) and a third-party diabetes data platform, Tidepool. The principal investigator reviewed glucose data daily in the EHR and Tidepool and contacted the participants as needed for insulin dose adjustments during the time between hospital discharge and first clinic appointment. Families in the control group received usual care, which involved keeping written records of glucose values and contacting the diabetes team daily by telephone to relay data and receive treatment recommendations. A total of 40 families (20 for the intervention group and 20 for the control group) participated in the study. All families were surveyed at 1 month and 6 months regarding self-review of glucose data and ease of contacting the diabetes team. RESULTS: Patient-generated glucose data were remotely accessible for 100% of the participants via Tidepool and for 85% via the EHR. Survey data indicated that families in the intervention group were more likely than those in the control group to review their glucose data using mobile health apps after 1 month (P<.001), but by 6 months, this difference had disappeared. Perceived ease of contacting the clinical team for assistance was lower for the intervention group after 6 months (when receiving usual care) in comparison to during the intervention period (P=.48) and compared with a control group who did not have exposure to remote monitoring (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: Remote glucose monitoring is feasible among pediatric patients with newly diagnosed T1D and may be associated with the earlier adoption of mobile health apps for self-management. The use of broadscale remote monitoring for T1D in the future will depend on improved access to Bluetooth-enabled mobile devices for all patients, improved interoperability of mobile health apps to enable data transfer on Android as well as Apple devices, and new provider workflows to handle large-scale panel management based on patient-generated health data.

A small percentage of multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnoses occur before the age of 18 years. Before treatment initiation, a careful differential diagnosis and exclusion of other similar acquired demyelinating syndromes such as anti-aquaporin-4-associated neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4-NMOSD) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody spectrum disorder (MOGSD) is warranted. The recent 2017 changes to the McDonald criteria can successfully predict up to 71% of MS diagnoses and have good specificity of 95% and sensitivity of 71%. Additional measures such as the presence of T1-weighted hypointense lesions and/or contrast-enhancing lesions significantly increase the accuracy of diagnosis. In adults, early use of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) is instrumental to a better long-term prognosis, including lower rates of relapse and disability worsening, and numerous FDA-approved therapies for adult-onset MS are available. However, unlike their adult counterparts, the development, testing, and regulatory approval of POMS treatments have been significantly slower and hindered by logistic and/or ethical considerations. Currently, only two MS DMTs (fingolimod and teriflunomide) have been tested in large phase III trials and approved by regulatory agencies for use in POMS. First-line therapies not approved by the FDA for use in children (interferon-β and glatiramer acetate) are also commonly used and result in a significant reduction in inflammatory activity when compared with non-treated POMS patients. An increasing number of POMS patients are now treated with moderate efficacy therapies such as dimethyl fumarate and high-efficacy therapies such as natalizumab, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, anti-CD52 monoclonal antibodies, and/or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. These high-efficacy DMTs generally provide additional reduction in inflammatory activity when compared with the first-line medications (up to 62% of relapse-rate reduction). Therefore, a number of phase II and III trials are currently investigating their efficacy and safety in POMS patients. In this review, we discuss potential changes in the regulatory approval process for POMS patients that are recommended for DMTs already approved for the adult MS population, including smaller sample size for pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies, MRI-centered primary outcomes, and/or inclusion of teenagers in the adult trials.",2021-12-23,"Jakimovski, Dejan; Awan, Samreen; Eckert, Svetlana P.; Farooq, Osman; Weinstock-Guttman, Bianca",CNS Drugs,,document_parses/pdf_json/4d52cce027b3946c95a74f29a8a158e643aa487f.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34940954/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40263-021-00887-w,245426837.0,2021,354

And, to what extent was the change driven by COVID-specific factors, such as personal worry about the disease and COVID-specific misinformation, and to what extent by background (non–COVID-specific) factors, such as trust in medical authorities, accurate/inaccurate information about vaccination, vaccination history, and patterns of media reliance? This panel study of more than 8,000 individuals found that trust in health authorities anchored acceptance of vaccination and that knowledge about vaccination, flu vaccination history, and patterns of media reliance played a more prominent role in shifting individuals from vaccination hesitance to acceptance than COVID-specific factors. COVID-specific conspiracy beliefs did play a role, although a lesser one.

METHODS: Corona Immunitas is a research program of coordinated, population-based, seroprevalence studies implemented by Swiss School of Public Health (SSPH+). Over 28,340 participants, randomly selected and age-stratified, with some regional specificities will be included. Additional studies in vulnerable and highly exposed subpopulations are also planned. The studies will assess population immunological status during the pandemic. RESULTS: Phase one (first wave of pandemic) estimates from Geneva showed a steady increase in seroprevalence up to 10.8% (95% CI 8.2–13.9, n = 775) by May 9, 2020. Since June, Zurich, Lausanne, Basel City/Land, Ticino, and Fribourg recruited a total of 5973 participants for phase two thus far. CONCLUSIONS: Corona Immunitas will generate reliable, comparable, and high-quality serological and epidemiological data with extensive coverage of Switzerland and of several subpopulations, informing health policies and decision making in both economic and societal sectors.

Studies have revealed that the genome encodes about 16 non-structural proteins (nsp), four structural proteins, and six or seven accessory proteins. Based on prevalent knowledge on SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses, functions have been assigned for majority of the proteins. While, researchers across the globe are engrossed in identifying a potential pharmacological intervention to control the viral outbreak, none of the work has come up with new antiviral drugs or vaccines yet. One possible approach that has shown some positive results is by treating infected patients with the plasma collected from convalescent COVID-19 patients. Several vaccines around the world have entered their final trial phase in humans and we expect that these will in time be available for application to worldwide population to combat the disease. In this work we analyse the effect of prevalent mutations in the major pathogenesis related proteins of SARS-COV2 and attempt to pinpoint the effects of those mutations on the structural stability of the proteins. Our observations and analysis direct us to identify that all the major mutations have a negative impact in context of stability of the viral proteins under study and the mutant proteins suffer both structural and functional alterations as a result of the mutations. Our binary scoring scheme identifies L84S mutation in ORF8 as the most disruptive of the mutations under study.

Synthesis of the available studies significantly strengthens the quality of evidences for public health practice. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the overall magnitude of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course of infection using available evidences. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA checklist to present this study. Two experienced review authors (MA and DBK) were systematically searched international electronic databases for studies. We performed meta-analysis using R statistical software. The overall weighted proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course infection was computed. The pooled estimates with 95% confidence intervals were presented using forest plot. Egger’s tests were used to assess publication bias, and primary estimates were pooled using a random effects model. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to assure the robustness of the result. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies that satisfied the eligibility criteria were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Consequently, in the meta-analysis, a total of 6,071 COVID-19 cases were included. The proportion of asymptomatic infections among the included studies ranged from 1.4% to 78.3%. The findings of this meta-analysis showed that the weighted pooled proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases throughout the course of infection was 25% (95%CI: 16–38).

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare but are frequently diagnosed at advanced stages and require systemic therapy. Patients and methods. This multicenter, open-label, phase II study evaluated sunitinib in Japanese patients with well-differentiated pancreatic NET. Patients received sunitinib 37.5 mg/day on a continuous daily dosing (CDD) schedule. The primary endpoint was clinical benefit rate (CBR; percentage of complete responses [CRs] plus partial responses [PRs] plus stable disease [SD] ≥24 weeks). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), tumor shrinkage, progression-free survival (PFS) probability, safety, pharmacokinetics, and biomarkers. Results. Twelve patients received treatment. The CBR was 75 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 43–94) and included 6 patients with a PR and 3 with SD. The ORR was 50 % (95 % CI, 21–79). PFS probability was 91 % (95 % CI, 54–99) at 6 months and 71 % (95 % CI, 34–90) at 12 months. Commonly reported treatment-emergent (all-causality), any-grade adverse events included diarrhea (n = 10), hand–foot syndrome and hypertension (both n = 8), fatigue and headache (both n = 7), and neutropenia (n = 6). No deaths on study were reported; one death due to disease progression occurred >28 days after end of treatment. Sunitinib on a CDD schedule resulted in sustained drug concentrations without accumulation across cycles. Tumor responses in all 12 patients did not appear to correlate with decreases in chromogranin A levels. Conclusions. Sunitinib 37.5 mg/day on a CDD schedule demonstrated antitumor activity in Japanese patients with unresectable, well-differentiated pancreatic NET.

COVID-19 vaccination has been recommended by national and international organizations in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). The aim of the study was to evaluate COVID-19 vaccine willingness and hesitancy in a population of Italian patients with IBD, and their determinants. METHODS: In February 2021 an online questionnaire focused on COVID-19 vaccine was proposed to a representative sample of Italian IBD patients. Socio-demographic characteristics, IBD features, lifestyle, perception of COVID-19, general attitude towards vaccinations and to COVID-19 vaccines were investigated. Patients were divided into willing, hesitant and refusive towards COVID-19 vaccine. The hesitation reasons were investigated. The associations between baseline characteristics and willingness (determinants) were evaluated by calculating crude and adjusted Odds Ratio (AdjOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: The baseline characteristics are shown below. 1252 surveys were collected. 1005 (80.3%), 222 (18.1%) and 33 (2.63 %) patients were defined as willing, hesitant and refusive, respectively. Concerns for vaccine adverse effects constituted the main reason for refusal (73.4%) (Figure). 49.1% of hesitant patients reported that presence of IBD exerted an influence on their answer. Among the patients willing to be vaccinated whenever possible, 78.2% (786) thought that their IBD represented a valid motivation to access vaccination with priority. Willingness to COVID-19 vaccine was significantly associated with adherence to previous vaccinations (AdjOR 17.6, 95% CI 11.4–27.2), male gender (1.68 95% CI 1.16–2.43), graduation degree (1.48, 95% CI 1.03–2.13), perceived higher risk of COVID-19 due to IBD (1.47, 95% CI 1.05–2.08), alcohol intake (1.69, 95% CI 1.16–2.45). Conversely, the hesitancy was significantly associated with use of complementary and alternative medicines (0.58, 95% CI 0.36–0.92). Notably, 54.5% of patients were under the impression to have a higher risk of COVID-19 and 31.8% a more severe course due to their IBD. [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Most IBD patients would accept COVID-19 vaccines, though one out of five is hesitant to date, principally due to fear of adverse events.

To date, there is no study from the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia determining the proportion and severity of hMPV infection among pediatric hospitalized patients with respiratory infections. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to determine the presence of hMPV antigens in the nasopharyngeal secretions of pediatric patients hospitalized with respiratory tract infections in the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, serological hospital-based study included all pediatric patients who were admitted to Aseer Central Hospital, Abha, Saudi Arabia, from July 2016 to November 2017 with upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections. Basic demographics of patients and their clinical data on and after admission were recorded. Direct fluorescent antibody assay was used to detect the presence of hMPV antigens in the obtained nasopharyngeal secretion specimens. RESULTS: During the study, 91 pediatric patients were hospitalized due to upper and/or lower respiratory tract infections, of which 9.9% were positive for hMPV. These patients were aged 9 months to 16 years, were from Abha city or its surrounding localities and were mostly (77.8%) hospitalized during autumn or winter. The most common diagnosis on admission was bronchopneumonia (55.5%) and aspiration pneumonia (22.2%), and some patients also had underlying chronic conditions such as chronic heart disease (22.2%) and bronchial asthma (11.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained indicated that hMPV is a potential etiologic factor for the commonly occurring acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children from the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia. hMPV infection was also found to be associated with complicated respiratory conditions such as bronchopneumonia, chronic heart disease and bronchial asthma.",2019-04-12,"Alsuheel, Ali Mohammed; Ali, Abdelwahid Saeed; Al-Hakami, Ahmed Musa; Shati, Ayed Abdullah; Chandramoorthy, Harish C.; Al-Qahtani, Saleh Mohammed",Saudi J Med Med Sci,,document_parses/pdf_json/f9738261ac322d052e519fb1f1297eedc917a939.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6503696/,,2019,279

The aim of this study was to assess and compare current practice and knowledge regarding PSM and examine satisfaction with available treatment options and need for alternative therapies in North Africa. METHODS: This is a qualitative study involving specialists participating in PSM management in North Africa. The survey analyzed demographic characteristics and current knowledge and opinions regarding PSM management in different institutions. We also looked at goals and priorities, satisfaction with treatment modalities and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) usefulness according to specialty, country, years of experience, and activity sector. RESULTS: One-hundred and three participants responded to the survey (response rate of 57%), including oncologists and surgeons. 59.2% of respondents had more than 10 years experience and 45.6% treated 20–50 PSM cases annually. Participants satisfaction with PSM treatment modalities was mild for gastric cancer (3/10 [IQR 2–3]) and moderate for colorectal (5/10 [IQR 3–5]), ovarian (5/10 [IQR 3–5]), and pseudomyxoma peritonei (5/10 [IQR 3–5]) type of malignancies. Good quality of life and symptom relief were rated as main priorities for treatment and the need for new treatment modalities was rated 9/10 [IQR 8–9]. The perceived usefulness of systemic chemotherapy in first intention was described as high by 42.7 and 39.8% of respondents for PSM of colorectal and gastric origins, while HIPEC was described as highly useful for ovarian (49.5%) and PMP (73.8) malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: The management of PSM in the North African region has distinct differences in knowledge, treatments availability and priorities.

However, among the patients that are symptomatic, influenza-like illnesses including fever, myalgia and respiratory symptoms seem to be the most common presentation across age groups. Though respiratory illness seems to be the primary presentation, about 36.4% to 69% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have exhibited neurological manifestations. We present two patients who were hospitalized for the presenting symptom of acute encephalopathy. Both the patients regained consciousness within 24 to 48 hours of initiating treatment. The first patient was known to have mild cognitive impairment and a thorough work-up was done in the emergency department which did not reveal any other causes apart from positive SARS-CoV-2 rapid PCR test. The second patient was from a long-term care facility with underlying dementia, usually alert, awake and oriented to self and presented with severe encephalopathy with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 3 on admission. Her work up was notable only for a positive SARS-CoV-2 rapid polymerase chain reaction test. Both patients responded well to standard remdesivir and steroid therapy and returned to baseline cognition. SARS-COV 2 virus appears to be a causative agent of acute onset encephalopathy. Very little is known about the pathophysiology of neurological manifestations in COVID-19 illness.

Tear secretion, tear break-up time and corneal staining were measured. MATERIAL AND METHODS A preclinical and short-term prospective study was performed. Twenty New Zealand white rabbits were divided into 5 groups, with 4 rabbits per group, each receiving a different concentration of Artemia salina. In each rabbit, an extract of Artemia salina (2%, 4%, 6%, 8% or 10%) was randomly instilled in one eye and saline solution (negative control) in the other eye. Tear secretion, tear break-up time and corneal staining were measured before and after the instillation of 5 drops per eye (1 drop per hour) on the same day. RESULTS In tear secretion, there was an increase of 43.88 ± 6.73% with 4% Artemia salina in comparison with its baseline measurement (P = 0.049). The rest of the groups did not show differences (P ≥ 0.05). For tear break-up time, none of the groups showed differences (P ≥ 0.05), while for corneal staining score, there was an improvement of 0.88 ± 0.83 with 4% Artemia salina (P = 0.038) and a deterioration of 0.50 ± 0.83 with control solution (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS Short-term instillation of eye drops with 4% Artemia salina produced both stimulation of tear secretion and a slight improvement of physiological corneal staining. Besides, all the doses of up to 10% Artemia salina did not produce undesirable side effects on the ocular surface. Therefore, these eye drops are presented as a possible new treatment for dry eye due to their secretagogue properties and ocular surface regeneration.",2020-06-30,"Carpena-Torres, Carlos; Pintor, Jesús; Huete-Toral, Fernando; Rodriguez-Pomar, Candela; Martínez-Águila, Alejandro; Carracedo, Gonzalo",Current eye research,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/02713683.2020.1789665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602751/,220271816.0,2020,273

METHODS: This prospective investigation evaluated travelers returning from countries with endemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009, and who were seen in our department at the onset of the outbreak (April–July 2009). Patients were included if they presented with signs of RTI that occurred during travel or less than 7 days after return from overseas travel. Patients were evaluated for microbial agents with RespiFinder plus assay, and throat culture according to clinical presentation. RESULTS: A total of 113 travelers (M/F ratio 1.2:1; mean age 39 y) were included. They were mainly tourists (n = 50; 44.2%) mostly returning from North America (n = 65; 58%) and Mexico (n = 21; 18.5%). The median duration of travel was 23 days (range 2–540 d). The median lag time between return and onset of illness was 0.2 days (range 10 d prior to 7 d after). The main clinical presentation of RTI was influenza‐like illness (n = 76; 67.3%). Among the 99 microbiologically evaluated patients, a pathogen was found by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or throat culture in 65 patients (65.6%). The main etiological agents were influenza A(H1N1) 2009 (18%), influenza viruses (14%), and rhinovirus (20%).

In developing an ecosystem for a hydrogen economy, South Korea is focused on increasing the production and use of hydrogen vehicles, establishing an ecosystem for the production and distribution of hydrogen and related technologies, and expanding the production of fuel cells. The government’s vision has the backing of key industrial firms, most importantly the Hyundai Motors Group which plans on investing 7.6 trillion won ($6.7 billion) under its “FCEV Vision 2030” and is part of the HyNet consortium to build 100 new hydrogen refueling stations in South Korea by 2022. If South Korea’s vision is successful, it expects hydrogen to account for 5% of its projected power consumption in 2040, to see its economy grow by 43 trillion won, 420,000 new jobs created, and significant reductions in both fine dust and greenhouse gas emission.

Informal social gatherings are a potentially important mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, but studying their role in transmission is challenged by data and methodological limitations; birthdays offer an opportunity to empirically quantify the potential role of small social gatherings in COVID-19 spread. Objective To assess the association between social gatherings and SARS-CoV-2 transmission by studying whether COVID-19 rates increase after birthdays in a household. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study used nationwide data from January 1 to November 8, 2020, from 2.9 million US households with private insurance to compare COVID-19 infections between households with and without a birthday in the preceding 2 weeks, stratified according to county-level COVID-19 prevalence in that week and adjusting for household size and both week- and county-specific differences. The study also compared how birthday-associated infection rates differed by type of birthday (eg, child vs adult birthday, or a milestone birthday such as a 50th birthday), county-level precipitation on the Saturday of each week (which could move gatherings indoors), political leanings in the county, and state shelter-in-place policies. Main Outcomes and Measures Household-level COVID-19 infection. Results Among the 2.9 million households in the study, in the top decile of counties in COVID-19 prevalence, households with a birthday in the 2 weeks prior had 8.6 more diagnoses per 10 000 individuals (95% CI, 6.6-10.7 per 10 000 individuals) compared with households without a birthday in the 2 weeks prior, a relative increase of 31% above the county-level prevalence of 27.8 cases per 10 000 individuals, vs 0.9 more diagnoses per 10 000 individuals (95% CI, 0.6-1.3 per 10 000 individuals) in the fifth decile (P < .001 for interaction). Households in the tenth decile of COVID-19 prevalence had an increase in COVID-19 diagnoses of 15.8 per 10 000 persons (95% CI, 11.7-19.9 per 10 000 persons) after a child birthday, compared with an increase of 5.8 per 10 000 persons (95% CI, 3.7-7.9 per 10 000 persons) among households with an adult birthday (P < .001 in a test of interactions). No differences were found by milestone birthdays, county political leaning, precipitation, or shelter-in-place policies.

AIM: To explore the views and experiences of Twitter social media users who reported that a relative, friend or acquaintance died of COVID-19 without a family member/friend present. DESIGN: Qualitative content analysis of English-language tweets. DATA SOURCES: Twitter data collected 7–20th April 2020. A bespoke software system harvested selected publicly-available tweets from the Twitter application programming interface. After filtering we hand-screened tweets to include only those referring to a relative, friend or acquaintance who died alone of COVID-19. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. RESULTS: 9328 tweets were hand-screened; 196 were included. Twitter users expressed sadness, despair, hopelessness and anger about their experience and loss. Saying goodbye via video-conferencing technology was viewed ambivalently. Clinicians’ presence during a death was little consolation. Anger, frustration and blame were directed at governments’ inaction/policies or the public. The sadness of not being able to say goodbye as wished was compounded by lack of social support and disrupted after-death rituals. Users expressed a sense of political neglect/mistreatment alongside calls for action. They also used the platform to reinforce public health messages, express condolences and pay tribute.

The purpose of this review is to provide a survey of pediatric cell-free DNA (cfDNA) studies, illustrate their potential applications in pediatric oncology, and to discuss technological challenges and approaches to overcome these hurdles. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent literature has demonstrated liquid biopsies’ ability to inform treatment selection at diagnosis, monitor clonal evolution during treatment, sensitively detect minimum residual disease following local control, and provide sensitive posttherapy surveillance. Advantages include reduced procedural anesthesia, molecular profiling unbiased by tissue heterogeneity, and ability to track clonal evolution. Challenges to wider implementation in pediatric oncology, however, include blood volume restrictions and relatively low mutational burden in childhood cancers. Multiomic approaches address challenges presented by low-mutational burden, and novel bioinformatic analyses allow a single assay to yield increasing amounts of information, reducing blood volume requirements.

Convenience sample surveys indicate that recovery began soon after. Using a probability sample, we tracked mental health during the pandemic to characterise mental health trajectories and identify predictors of deterioration. METHODS This study was a secondary analysis of five waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (a large, national, probability-based survey that has been collecting data continuously since January, 2009) from late April to early October, 2020 and pre-pandemic data taken from 2018-19. Mental health was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). We used latent class mixed models to identify discrete mental health trajectories and fixed-effects regression to identify predictors of change in mental health. FINDINGS Mental health was assessed in 19 763 adults (≥16 years; 11 477 [58·1%] women and 8287 [41·9%] men; 3453 [17·5%] participants from minority ethnic groups). Mean population mental health deteriorated with the onset of the pandemic and did not begin improving until July, 2020. Latent class analysis identified five distinct mental health trajectories up to October 2020. Most individuals in the population had either consistently good (7437 [39·3%] participants) or consistently very good (7623 [37·5%] participants) mental health across the first 6 months of the pandemic. A recovering group (1727 [12·0%] participants) showed worsened mental health during the initial shock of the pandemic and then returned to around pre-pandemic levels of mental health by October, 2020. The two remaining groups were characterised by poor mental health throughout the observation period; for one group, (523 [4·1%] participants) there was an initial worsening in mental health that was sustained with highly elevated scores. The other group (1011 [7·0%] participants) had little initial acute deterioration in their mental health, but reported a steady and sustained decline in mental health over time. These last two groups were more likely to have pre-existing mental or physical ill-health, to live in deprived neighbourhoods, and be of Asian, Black or mixed ethnicity. Infection with SARS-CoV-2, local lockdown, and financial difficulties all predicted a subsequent deterioration in mental health. INTERPRETATION Between April and October 2020, the mental health of most UK adults remained resilient or returned to pre-pandemic levels. Around one in nine individuals had deteriorating or consistently poor mental health. People living in areas affected by lockdown, struggling financially, with pre-existing conditions, or infection with SARS-CoV-2 might benefit most from early intervention.

Existing research has focused on discrimination against Asians and is primarily based on self-reported incidents or nonrepresentative samples. We investigate the extent to which COVID-19 has fueled prejudice and discrimination against multiple racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States by examining nationally representative survey data with an embedded vignette experiment about roommate selection (collected in August 2020; n = 5,000). We find that priming COVID-19 salience has an immediate, statistically significant impact: compared to the control group, respondents in the treatment group exhibited increased prejudice and discriminatory intent against East Asian, South Asian, and Hispanic hypothetical room-seekers. The treatment effect is more pronounced in increasing extreme negative attitudes toward the three minority groups than decreasing extreme positive attitudes toward them. This is partly due to the treatment increasing the proportion of respondents who perceive these minority groups as extremely culturally incompatible (Asians and Hispanics) and extremely irresponsible (Asians). Sociopolitical factors did not moderate the treatment effects on attitudes toward Asians, but prior social contact with Hispanics mitigated prejudices against them.

In this regard, patients with autoimmune diseases or those receiving immunosuppressive agents and anti-cancer therapies, need special attention. However, no confirmed data is presently available regarding COVID-19 vaccines in these populations due to exclusion from the conducted clinical trials. Given the probable suppression or over-activation of the immune system in such patients, reaching a consensus for their vaccination is critical, besides gathering data and conducting trials, which could probably clarify this matter in the future. In this review, besides a brief on the available COVID-19 vaccines, considerations and available knowledge about administering similar vaccines in patients with cancer, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, solid organ transplantation, multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and rheumatologic and dermatologic autoimmune disorders are summarized to help in decision making. As discussed, live-attenuated viruses, which should be avoided in these groups, are not employed in the present COVID-19 vaccines. Thus, the main concern regarding efficacy could be met using a potent COVID-19 vaccine.

RESULTS: Our findings convey a significant adverse impact on alcohol-focused NGOs and community-based organizations in West Africa. Overall, 94% of participants indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted their organizations’ work. In addition, 71% of participants reported reduced access to alcohol treatment or support in their communities. Lastly, 44% of the respondents indicated that people in their community drank less alcohol than usual, and only 33% answered that they perceived it to be harder to get alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: These data underscore the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across West Africa with respect to accessing alcohol treatment and organizational capacity to address alcohol harm. With the lack of infrastructure to address alcohol harm, this impact could exacerbate the high level of alcohol use and harm in the region.",2022-04-05,"Swahn, Monica H.; Balenger, Adelaide; Umenze, Franklin; Aneja, Ritu; Bureh, Thomas A.; W.

After accounting for the effects of travel restrictions and control measures, we find that the number of infections in Wuhan could have been 39% lower than the actual number if the medical capacity were doubled in this city.

These were run by Foundation Trainees in psychiatry with supervision and oversight from a senior psychiatrist. This study aims to review current literature on remote teaching as a learning resource and will evaluate the effectiveness of clinical simulation as an alternative to patient contact, with the focus being on improving students’ confidence as well as developing clinical interview skills. METHOD: Feedback surveys were developed, focussing on confidence undertaking difficult aspects of psychiatric interviews, and distributed amongst two cohorts of medical students at the University of Sheffield. One cohort completed their face-to-face psychiatry placement in full pre-COVID, the other undertook placements consisting of virtual simulation sessions alongside reduced patient contact. Responses were collected online over 6 weeks between February and March 2021. As two medical students who completed face-to-face psychiatry placement prior to the pandemic, we have additionally submitted personal reflections as a comparator to current student experiences. RESULT: A total of 8 students in the clinical simulation cohort, and a total of 13 students from the face-to-face teaching cohort completed the questionnaire. 62.5% of students that responded were female and the remaining percentage identified as male. Students in the face-to-face cohort reported being more confident in 6 out of 7 aspects of our feedback surveys determining confidence undertaking clinical interview skills in comparison to the virtual simulation cohort. Students attended varying numbers of simulation sessions and ultimately the main restrictions and barriers to the simulation teaching reported by students are the time constraints during the sessions, and unstable internet connection. CONCLUSION: Overall confidence levels in medical students are undoubtedly higher in students that completed full face-to-face placements in comparison to those with combined teaching. Based on student responses and review of current literature, clinical simulation appears to serve as a useful adjunct to students with reduced face-to-face contact in psychiatry, particularly for increasing confidence when interviewing more challenging patients. Immediate facilitator feedback and exposure to more difficult patient scenarios seem to be the most beneficial aspects. We would not advocate it as an exclusive form of teaching for medical students, but it may be a useful resource post-pandemic for providing students with extra learning opportunities, specifically targeted at developing confidence and skills in more difficult situations which will hopefully benefit them in their later careers.",2021-06-18,"Mitchell, Philippa; Varnish, Ella; Das, Arthita",BJPsych Open,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8772334/,,2021,401

METHODS: Seventy-four right eyes of 74 participants were included in the study. Participants completed the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire, and NI-BUT measurements were performed between 08.30–09.00 and 16.30–17.00 h. Participants with an initial NI-BUT measurement below 17 s were classified as group-1, and those over 17 s were classified as group-2.

The mean OSDI score of the participants was 28.6 ± 17.1. NI-BUT means of group-1 at baseline and 8th hour were 11.4 ± 3.3 and 7.9 ± 3.6 s, respectively, and the mean NI-BUT at the 8th hour was statistically significantly lower than the baseline (p < 0.0001). Also, 24.2% (8 people) of those in group-2 had the 8th-hour NI-BUT value fallen into the measurable range (below 17 s). No significant correlation was found between the decrease in NI-BUT value and age, gender, and OSDI (p = 0.08, p = 0.3, and p = 0.2, respectively).

Analyze and forecast COVID-19 cases and deaths growth could be useful in many ways, governments could estimate medical equipment and take appropriate policy responses, and experts could approximate the peak and the end of the disease. In this work, we first train a time series Prophet model to analyze and forecast the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Algeria based on the previously reported numbers. Then, to better understand the spread and the properties of the COVID-19, we include external factors that may contribute to accelerate/slow the spread of the virus, construct a dataset from reliable sources, and conduct a large-scale data analysis considering 82 countries worldwide. The evaluation results show that the time series Prophet model accurately predicts the number of cases and deaths in Algeria with low RMSE scores of 218.87 and 4.79 respectively, while the forecast suggests that the total number of cases and deaths are expected to increase in the coming weeks. Moreover, the worldwide data-driven analysis reveals several correlations between the increase/decrease in the number of cases and deaths and external factors that may contribute to accelerate/slow the spread of the virus such as geographic, climatic, health, economic, and demographic factors.",2020-07-19,"Belkacem, Sami",,,document_parses/pdf_json/c644d963d11ea337aced48903a2c223911fe2e9a.json,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09755v1.pdf,220646800.0,2020,243

An alternative strategy is a small change approach, which asks people to make small(er) changes to their diet and/or physical activity behaviors (e.g., 100-kcal reduction or increases of 1000 steps/day). This approach may lead to sustained weight management because such energy-deficit goals are easier for people to integrate into their lives and then maintain. This systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials assessed the effectiveness of a small change approach for weight management; 21 trials were included. In weight gain prevention trials with adults, the mean difference in weight change between groups was -0.7 kg (95% CI -1.0 to -0.4, 95% PI -1.1 to -0.3) at program-end and -0.9 kg (95% CI -1.5 to -0.3, 95% PI -3.1 to 1.3) at last follow-up, favoring small change interventions.

It is widely assumed that social cohesion, public confidence in government sources of health information and general concern for the welfare of others support health advisories during a pandemic and save lives. We tested this assumption through a time-series analysis of cross-national differences in COVID-19 mortality during an early phase of the pandemic. Country data on income inequality and four dimensions of social capital (trust, group affiliations, civic responsibility and confidence in public institutions) were linked to data on COVID-19 deaths in 84 countries. Associations with deaths were examined using Poisson regression with population-averaged estimators. During a 30-day period after recording their tenth death, mortality was positively related to income inequality, trust and group affiliations and negatively related to social capital from civic engagement and confidence in state institutions. These associations held in bivariate and mutually controlled regression models with controls for population, age and wealth. The results indicate that societies that are more economically unequal and lack capacity in some dimensions of social capital experienced more COVID-19 deaths. Social trust and belonging to groups were associated with more deaths, possibly due to behavioural contagion and incongruence with physical distancing policy.

This lack also reduces our understanding of the epidemiology associated with S. suis in the United States and thus affects the efficiency of control and prevention strategies. In this study we applied whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based approaches for the characterization of S. suis and identification of VAGs. RESULTS: Of 208 S. suis isolates classified as pathogenic, possibly opportunistic, and commensal pathotypes, the genotype based on the classical VAGs (epf, mrp, and sly encoding the extracellular protein factor, muramidase-release protein, and suilysin, respectively) was identified in 9% (epf+/mrp+/sly+) of the pathogenic pathotype. Using the chi-square test and LASSO regression model, the VAGs ofs (encoding the serum opacity factor) and srtF (encoding sortase F) were selected out of 71 published VAGs as having a significant association with pathotype, and both genes were found in 95% of the pathogenic pathotype. The ofs+/srtF+ genotype was also present in 74% of ‘pathogenic’ isolates from a separate validation set of isolates. Pan-genome clustering resulted in the differentiation of a group of isolates from five swine production companies into clusters corresponding to clonal complex (CC) and virulence-associated (VA) genotypes. The same CC-VA genotype patterns were identified in multiple production companies, suggesting a lack of association between production company, CC, or VA genotype. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed ofs and srtF genes were stronger predictors for differentiating pathogenic and commensal S. suis isolates compared to the classical VAGs in two sets of U.S. isolates. Pan-genome analysis in combination with metadata (serotype, ST/CC, VA genotype) was illustrated to be a valuable subtyping tool to describe the genetic diversity of S. suis.

The primary focus is on the regions of recirculating flow that can harbor infectious aerosol for much longer than the well-ventilated parts of the room. Computational fluid dynamics is used to obtain the steady state air flow field, and Lagrangian tracking of particles gives the spatial and temporal distribution of infectious aerosol in the domain. It is found that the washbasin located next to the door is in a prominent recirculation zone, and particles injected in this region take much longer to be evacuated. The ventilation rate is found to be governed by the air residence time in the recirculation zone, and it is much higher than the timescale based on fully mixed reactor model of the room.

However, there are no effective treatments for this condition. Recent research suggests that continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS), a non-invasive brain stimulation, can reduce pain level, improve cognitive function and affective symptoms in multiple diseases or dysfunctions, including anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, sleep disorders and pain. But the potential benefits of cTBS in reducing postoperative delirium have not been investigated. Therefore, we propose determining whether cTBS can prevent and/or treat postoperative delirium in senior patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The study will be a double-blind, randomised controlled trial. Participants (65 years old or older) undergoing scheduled orthopaedic surgery (≥2 hours, general anaesthesia) will be randomised to receive either cTBS or sham stimulation with a focal figure-of-eight coil over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 80% of the resting motor threshold. Every patient will receive 2-3 sets of stimulations during postoperative days (40 s per session, 3 sessions per set, 1 set per day). Participants will be assessed twice daily by a research assistant blinded to allocation. The primary outcome will be the incidence of postoperative delirium measured by the Confusion Assessment Method on postoperative days 1, 2 and 3. The secondary outcomes will be the severity and duration of postoperative delirium, cognitive function, pain, sleep quality, activities of daily living, length of hospital stay, discharge-to-facility or home, and rate of complication and mortality during the hospital stay.

In this work, the features of the input image are enhanced with the integration of Multi-Resolution Analysis (MRA) and a CNN framework without costing more convolution filters. The bottleneck with conventional activation functions, used in CNN’s, is the nullification of the feature maps that are negative in value. In this work, a novel Hyper-analytic Wavelet (HW) phase activation function is formulated with unique characteristics for the wavelet sub-bands. Instead of dismissal, the function transforms these negative coefficients that correspond to significant edge feature maps. The hyper-analytic wavelet phase forms the imaginary part of the complex activation. And the hyper-parameter of the activation function is selected such that the corresponding magnitude spectrum produces monotonic and effective activations. The performance of 3 CNN models (1 custom, shallow CNN, ResNet with Soft attention, Alex Net for DR) with spatial–Wavelet quilts is better. With the spatial–Wavelet quilts, the Alex Net for DR has an improvement with an 11% of accuracy level (from 87 to 98%). The highest accuracy level of 98% and the highest Sensitivity of 99% are attained through Modified Alex Net for DR. The proposal also illustrates the visualization of the negative edge preservation with assumed image patches. From this study, the researcher infers that models with spatial–Wavelet quilts, with the hyper-analytic activations, have better generalization ability. And the visualization of heat maps provides evidence of better learning of the feature maps from the wavelet sub-bands.",2022-04-25,"Chandrasekaran, Raja; Loganathan, Balaji",Vis Comput,,document_parses/pdf_json/ad7983fe0905982e0b2d245197cfe186bb126033.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00371-022-02489-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35493724/,248388228.0,2022,274

At present, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are being considered for first-line therapeutics for malignant GBM. Nonetheless, molecular markers for malignant GBM are unavailable at present. As a result, it is important to explore molecular markers related to immunity for GBM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study adopted a deconvolution algorithm for quantifying immunocyte composition and measuring gene expression, and used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to analyze GBM expression data obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), and the Cancer Genome Atlas Glioblastoma Multiforme (TCGA-GBM) databases. Thereafter, key CD8+ T cell infiltration-related genes and modules were identified, and database analysis was conducted to verify the therapeutic and immune features of the selected genes. RESULTS: From this study, CD8+ T cell-related modules were identified. By using consistent clustering analysis, two panels of genes (red and green) with the highest correlation with CD8+ T cells infiltration were used to construct high-, low-expression groups, silent and/or mixed group of T cell infiltrations. In the high and low CD8+ T cell infiltration groups, a total of 535 differential genes were obtained, of which ten genes (RPS5, RPS6, FAU, RPS19, RPS23, RPS15A, RPS29, RPS14, RPS16, RPS27A) were identified through protein–protein interactions and co-expression network analysis. Post Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier (K-M) survival analysis, RPS5, RPS6, and RPS16 were selected as candidate prognostic biomarkers related to CD8+ T cells. CONCLUSION: The three associated genes RPS5, RPS6, and RPS16 were markedly related to degree of T cell infiltration and immune-related activated. We identified their potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets associated with the extent of CD8+ T cell infiltration in GBM.",2022-02-22,"Feng, Peng; Li, Yuchen; Tian, Zhijie; Qian, Yuan; Miao, Xingyu; Zhang, Yuelin",Int J Gen Med,,document_parses/pdf_json/a3bf1e85b0a7aaf978d69ee7e4f5ef9b24b45449.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8881922/,,2022,283

However, despite the vast number of highly effective vaccines, some infectious diseases still do not have vaccines available. New technologies are needed to fully realize the potential of vaccine development for both emerging infectious diseases and diseases for which there are currently no vaccines available. As can be seen by the success of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, nanoscale platforms are promising delivery vectors for effective and safe vaccines. Synthetic nanoscale platforms, including liposomes and inorganic nanoparticles and microparticles, have many advantages in the vaccine market, but often require multiple doses and addition of artificial adjuvants, such as aluminum hydroxide. Biologically derived nanoparticles, on the other hand, contain native pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which can reduce the need for artificial adjuvants. Biological nanoparticles can be engineered to have many additional useful properties, including biodegradability, biocompatibility, and are often able to self-assemble, thereby allowing simple scale-up from benchtop to large-scale manufacturing.

Although the two policies aim to reduce carbon emissions, they have different effects on enterprises’ production. Meanwhile, the development of remanufacturing caters to the low-carbon economy. Therefore, this article establishes the game models between an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and a remanufacturer under carbon-emission-constraint and carbon-trade policies, analyzing the production decisions of enterprises under different policies to compare the influence of the two policies on outsourcing remanufacturing. The main conclusions of the article are as follows: (1) Both carbon-emission-constraint and carbon-trade policies increase the unit retail price of remanufactured and new products, reducing the new products sales volume. However, the sales volume of remanufactured products only decreases if the discount rate is less than the rate of carbon emissions of the two products. (2) The upper limit of carbon emissions can affect the unit outsourcing cost. The unit cost of outsourcing under the carbon-emission-constraint policy is only higher when the upper limit of carbon emissions is less than a certain threshold, and the discount rate is larger than the proportion of carbon emissions for both products; otherwise, the unit outsourcing cost under the carbon-trade policy is higher. (3) Both policies lessen the total environmental implication. When the upper limit of carbon emissions is less than a particular threshold, the environmental effect of the two manufacturers under the carbon-emission-constraint policy is smaller; otherwise, the environmental impact is smaller under the carbon-trade policy.",2022-03-17,"Li, Qiuyue; Wang, Hao; Li, Zhenshan; Yuan, Shangwei",Int J Environ Res Public Health,,document_parses/pdf_json/371192b3b7b41d9a7ee24db1a9b697d63520b792.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35329274/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19063590,247611367.0,2022,259

c6brj6f7,,PMC; WHO,755 A Novel Modularized Intervention to Improve Sleep in Older Hospitalized Veterans,10.1093/sleep/zsab072.752,PMC8135776,,no-cc,"INTRODUCTION: Disturbed sleep in hospitalized patient populations is a highly prevalent phenomenon, with patients commonly reporting problems with shorter sleep duration, more frequent awakenings, and overall poorer sleep quality during hospital stay compared to at home. Sleep disturbance during hospitalization is especially problematic as sleep is associated with both physical and psychological well-being. Poorer sleep has been found to impact recovery outcomes in a number of patient populations including mild traumatic brain injury, chronic pain, and most recently, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The current analyses examined pilot data from a novel brief modularized sleep intervention implemented with older adult Veterans living on a subacute rehabilitation unit. METHODS: Participants were screened for sleep problems upon admission to the unit. Veterans who screened positive were invited to participate in the sleep intervention. Components of the intervention were selected based on screener responses and included group sleep hygiene psychoeducation, environmental accommodations (e.g. ear plugs, eye mask, soothing music), and CPAP use education. Measures completed at pre- and post- intervention assessed sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), global health functioning (PROMIS Global Health Scale), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9). Pre- and post- scores were compared using paired sample t-tests. Two samples t-tests compared change scores in PHQ-9 between groups. RESULTS: A total of 33 Veterans were included in the analyses (Mage = 69.6, 3 female, intervention group n = 21). Participants showed a trend toward decreased PHQ-9 scores following the intervention (t(16) = 1.58, p = 0.100). There were no significant effects of the intervention on sleep quality or global health. Compared to the non-intervention group, the intervention group showed greater decrease in PHQ-9 scores at the time of post-intervention (t(25) = .828, p = .025). CONCLUSION: Preliminary data suggests that a brief modularized sleep intervention may benefit depressive symptoms for older adults during hospitalization. Additional research is needed to better understand the impact of a brief intervention on self-reported sleep quality during the hospitalization period.

Exercising in virtual reality environments (VR Exergame) is becoming an increasingly feasible and enjoyable way to promote PA and well-being in PLWD/MCI. Although co-design can significantly improve the design of technology, it is rarely done with PLWD/MCI. This study uses participatory design methods and collaborative approaches to involve key stakeholders to develop and test a VR Exergame ""Seas the Day"", a novel solution targeting PLWD/MCI well-being. METHODS A multi-stage, user-centered co-design approach was used to custom-build VR Exergames tailored to the unique needs and abilities of PLWD/MCI based on a first generation of the prototype that was previously developed and tested with PLWD/MCI. This paper describes the next iteration of the prototype. Processes included concept ideation and brainstorming activities, iterative prototyping, and playtesting/input/feedback sessions with key stakeholders (PLWD/MCI, exercise professionals, engineers, VR game designers, content developers). RESULTS The multidisciplinary and collaborative design process occurred over 15 months (overlapping with COVID-19 pandemic) with 7 PLWD/MCI (6 females; M=81.3 years) and 9 exercise professionals (7 females; M=38.1 years) to date. The game was designed to target movements identified by exercise professionals and researchers (aerobic exercises, range of motion, seated-balance, quick response to stimuli) and is structured in three exercise stages (warm-up, conditioning, cool-down). To ensure safety of participants while using VR headsets, only seated upper-limb exercises were targeted. Stakeholder feedback regarding game mechanics, aesthetics, and visual/auditory cues were gathered during brainstorming and playtesting sessions and implemented into specific game-related scenarios (tai-chi, rowing, fishing). CONCLUSION We presented the process, outcomes, and challenges of adopting a participatory/collaborative approach with multiple stakeholder groups to co-design VR Exergames tailored to PLWD/MCI. Next steps will include a mixed-method evaluation of the VR Exergames among community-dwelling older adults and PLWD/MCI in retirement communities and long-term care to evaluate: i) feasibility and acceptability of use, ii) game user experience, iii) barriers/facilitators to uptake of VR Exergames; and iv) inform/validate VR Exergames gameplay metrics reflective of cognitive and motor performance.",2021-12-01,"Mehrabi, Samira; Muñoz, John E; Basharat, Aysha; Li, Yiru; Middleton, Laura E; Cao, Shi; Barnett-Cowan, Michael; Boger, Jennifer",Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.051278; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34971033/,245570075.0,2021,354

The selected mHealth apps were assessed based on two measures: (1) the WHO guidelines on digital health intervention and (2) the four dimensions of the mHealth technology fit framework. In addition, user feedback from experienced and non-experienced users was conducted to evaluate four dimensions of the apps. RESULTS: A total of 339 mHealth apps were generated from the initial search, remaining seven selected apps that met inclusion criteria. The results highlighted that mHealth apps reviewed had still not been widely used by the general public. The applications were purposed to disseminate information, conduct a self-risk assessment, provide an online community forum, and telemedicine or teleconsultation regarding COVID-19. Data services, including data storage, aggregation, and data exchange, are available in most apps. The rarest function found was contact tracing and assisting health management and health workers, such as the availability of testing facilities, reporting test results, and prescribing medication. The main issues reported were the lack of data security and data privacy protection, integration and infrastructures, usability, and usefulness. CONCLUSION: Our study highlighted the necessity to improve mHealth apps' functions related to assisting health workers and the function of digital contact tracing. An effort to increase public awareness regarding the use of mHealth is also necessary to streamline the function of this innovation. Policymakers must consider usefulness, usability, integration, and infrastructure issues to improve their mHealth function.",2022-05-04,"Sujarwoto, Sujarwoto; Augia, Trisfa; Dahlan, Hendery; Sahputri, Rindi Ardika Melsalasa; Holipah, Holipah; Maharani, Asri",Front Public Health,,document_parses/pdf_json/4596b9648d38a67ffc1648af3b33ab0a19a7612b.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.879695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35602145/,248508153.0,2022,368

In the absence of significant control interventions, the curve could be steep, with the number of COVID-19 cases growing exponentially. In fact, this level of proliferation may already be happening, since the number of patients infected in Italy closely follows an exponential trend. Thus, we propose a test. When the numbers are taken from an exponential distribution, it has been demonstrated that they automatically follow Benford’s Law (BL). As a result, if the current control interventions are successful and we flatten the curve (i.e., we slow the rate below an exponential growth rate), then the number of infections or deaths will not obey BL. For this reason, BL may be useful for assessing the effects of the current control interventions and may be able to answer the question, “How flat is flat enough?” In this study, we used an epidemic growth model in the presence of interventions to describe the potential for a flattened curve, and then investigated whether the epidemic growth model followed BL for ten selected countries with a relatively high mortality rate. Among these countries, South Korea showed a particularly high degree of control intervention. Although all of the countries have aggressively fought the epidemic, our analysis shows that all countries except for Japan satisfied BL, indicating the growth rates of COVID-19 were close to an exponential trend. Based on the simulation table in this study, BL test shows that the data from Japan is incorrect.",2020-12-01,"Lee, Kang-Bok; Han, Sumin; Jeong, Yeasung",Physica A,,document_parses/pdf_json/3494dd926098efafb912b8aa1dec66ea72c99a52.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378437120305719?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2020.125090; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834438/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378437120305719,221141038.0,2020,274

Here, we use smartphone proximity data to explore how social structure affects contact tracing of COVID-19. We model the spread of COVID-19 and find that the effectiveness of contact tracing depends strongly on social network structure and heterogeneous social activity. Contact tracing is shown to be remarkably effective in a workplace environment and the effectiveness depends strongly on the minimum duration of contact required to initiate quarantine. In a realistic social network, we find that forward contact tracing with immediate isolation can reduce an epidemic by more than 70%. In perspective, our findings highlight the necessity of incorporating social heterogeneity into models of mitigation strategies.

The main role of ACE2 is the degradation of Ang II resulting in the formation of angiotensin 1–7 (Ang 1–7) which opposes the actions of Ang II. Increased Ang II levels are thought to upregulate ACE2 activity, and in ACE2 deficient mice Ang II levels are approximately double that of wild-type mice, whilst Ang 1–7 levels are almost undetectable. Thus, ACE2 plays a crucial role in the RAS because it opposes the actions of Ang II. Consequently, it has a beneficial role in many diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease where its expression is decreased.

However, it’s a semi-invasive, time consuming, and chronic therapy with variable adherence. There are still no specific guideline recommendations for the management of patients on lipid apheresis. The purpose of this review is to discuss the clinical indications and major drawbacks of lipid apheresis in the light of recent evidence. RECENT FINDINGS: Lipoprotein apheresis should be initiated at early ages and performed frequently to receive the expected cardiovascular benefits. However, in clinical practice, most patients experience ineffective apheresis and fail to reach lipid targets. This real-world failure is due to several factors including late diagnosis, delayed referral, and improper frequency of procedures. All these denote that awareness is still low among physicians. Another important factor is the semi-invasive, time consuming nature of the apheresis, leading to high refusal and low adherence rates. Moreover, apheresis decreases quality of life and increases the risk of depression. Mental status is also deteriorated in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia on lipid apheresis. New effective lipid lowering agents are underway with promising cardiovascular results. SUMMARY: To overcome the drawbacks, a structured approach, including standardized protocols for lipoprotein apheresis with regular cardiovascular follow-up is warranted. New effective lipid lowering agents with documented cardiovascular benefit, should be integrated into the treatment algorithms of patients on lipoprotein apheresis.",2021-02-17,"Kayikcioglu, Meral",Curr Atheroscler Rep,,document_parses/pdf_json/8ec417590d38445d438c827e36a6945f5a8c7c59.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594522/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11883-021-00911-w,231939899.0,2021,222

Recent advances in neocortical microscopy have made possible new insights into neocortical PTE. However, it is very difficult to engender convincing neocortical PTE in rodents. Thus, large animal models that develop neocortical PTE may provide useful insights that also can be more comparable to human patients. Because gyrencephalic species have prolonged latent periods, long-term video EEG recording is required. Here, we report a fully subcutaneous EEG implant with synchronized video in freely ambulatory swine for up to 14 months during epileptogenesis following bilateral cortical impact injuries or sham surgery The advantages of this system include the availability of a commercially available system that is simple to install, a low failure rate after surgery for EEG implantation, radiotelemetry that enables continuous monitoring of freely ambulating animals, excellent synchronization to video to EEG, and a robust signal to noise ratio. The disadvantages of this system in this species and age are the accretion of skull bone which entirely embedded a subset of skull screws and EEG electrodes, and the inability to rearrange the EEG electrode array. These disadvantages may be overcome by splicing a subdural electrode strip to the electrode leads so that skull growth is less likely to interfere with long-term signal capture and by placing two implants for a more extensive montage. This commercially available system in this bilateral cortical impact swine model may be useful to a wide range of investigators studying epileptogenesis in PTE. Significance Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a cause of significant morbidity after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and is often drug-resistant. Robust, informative animal models would greatly facilitate PTE research. Ideally, this biofidelic model of PTE would utilize a species that approximates human brain anatomy, brain size, glial populations, and inflammatory pathways. An ideal model would also incorporate feasible methods for long-term video EEG recording required to quantify seizure activity. Here, we describe the first model of PTE in swine and describe a method for robust long-term video EEG monitoring for up to 14 months post-TBI.

EGCG showed no significant effects on cell viability, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis in porcine alveolar macrophages and MARC-145 cells. The treatment of cells with EGCG attenuated the replication of both highly pathogenic and less pathogenic PRRSV in vitro. The viral life cycle analysis demonstrated that EGCG affected PRRSV replication and assembly, but not viral attachment, entry, or release. Interestingly, EGCG treatment abrogated the increased lipid droplets formation and lipid content induced by PRRSV infection. We further demonstrated that EGCG blocked PRRSV-stimulated expression of the key enzymes in lipid synthesis. In addition, EGCG attenuated PRRSV-induced autophagy that is critical for PRRSV proliferation. The supplementation of oleic acid restored PRRSV replication and assembly under EGCG treatment. Together, our results support that EGCG inhibits PRRSV proliferation through disturbing lipid metabolism. IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped single-positive-stranded RNA virus that causes acute respiratory distress in piglets and reproductive failure in sows, resulting in huge economic losses to the global swine industry. Several lines of evidence have suggested the crucial roles of lipids in PRRSV proliferation. Our previous report demonstrated that PRRSV activated lipophagy to facilitate viral replication through downregulating the expression of N-Myc downstream-regulated gene 1. The manipulation of lipid metabolism may be a new perspective to prevent PRRSV spread. In the present study, we reported that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major component of green tea catechins, significantly attenuated PRRSV infection through inhibiting lipid synthesis and autophagy. Given that natural products derived from plants have helped in the prevention and treatment of various infectious diseases, EGCG has a great potential to serve as a safe and environmentally friendly natural compound to treat PRRSV infection.",2022-04-11,"Yu, Peng-Wei; Fu, Peng-Fei; Zeng, Lei; Qi, Yan-Li; Li, Xiu-Qing; Wang, Qi; Yang, Guo-Yu; Li, Hua-Wei; Wang, Jiang; Chu, Bei-Bei; Wang, Meng-Di",Microbiology spectrum,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.02276-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35404086/,248084032.0,2022,329

A healthy diet is undoubtedly a major contributor for promoting a “good” microbial community that turns out to be crucial for a fine-tuned symbiotic relationship with the host. Both microbial-derived components and produced metabolites elicit the activation of downstream cascades capable to modulate both local and systemic immune responses. A balance between host and gut microbiota is crucial to keep a healthy intestinal barrier and an optimal immune homeostasis, thus contributing to prevent disease occurrence. How dietary habits can impact gut microbiota and, ultimately, host immunity in health and disease has been the subject of intense study, especially with regard to metabolic diseases. Only recently, these links have started to be explored in relation to lung diseases. The objective of this review is to address the current knowledge on how diet affects gut microbiota and how it acts on lung function. As the immune system seems to be the key player in the cross-talk between diet, gut microbiota and the lungs, involved immune interactions are discussed. There are key nutrients that, when present in our diet, help in gut homeostasis and lead to a healthier lifestyle, even ameliorating chronic diseases. Thus, with this review we hope to incite the scientific community interest to use diet as a valuable non-pharmacological addition to lung diseases management. First, we talk about the intestinal microbiota and interactions through the intestinal barrier for a better understanding of the following sections, which are the main focus of this article: the way diet impacts the intestinal microbiota and the immune interactions of the gut–lung axis that can explain the impact of diet, a key modifiable factor influencing the gut microbiota in several lung diseases.",2021-05-19,"Espírito Santo, Christophe; Caseiro, Catarina; Martins, Maria João; Monteiro, Rosário; Brandão, Inês",Nutrients,,document_parses/pdf_json/2c69fc34cbf342d099f0270ad901a27472320af9.json,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13051716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34069415/,235229594.0,2021,302

The results allow prediction of the magnitude of cases which this endoscopic service might witness in the next months and planning of future actions accordingly. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in the gastroenterology department of a large urban tertiary care medical center from October 15, 2020, to November 15, 2020. In this institution, all patients proposed for endoscopic procedures under deep sedation must be submitted to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) detection. These results were thoroughly reviewed. RESULTS: In the 1-month period, a total of 833 different procedures were done in 833 patients admitted to the endoscopy unit. Of these, 167 (20%) were submitted to nasal swab for SARS-CoV-2. Only 1 (0.6%) was positive for this infection, and her procedure was postponed. This RT-PCR-positive patient was not symptomatic for CO­VID-19 infection at the time of preprocedure screening. She had no positive contacts for COVID-19 and had not traveled outside the country. CONCLUSION: We found that the proportion of patients proposed for an endoscopic intervention who were asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 was low. However, only one fifth of patients were tested and, considering the proportion of 0.6%, it is reasonable to consider that exposure of healthcare workers and other patients can occur. So, all prevention measures must be strictly followed.

Therefore, we propose a hierarchical targeted immunization strategy to settle this problem. In this novel strategy, importance of the hierarchical structure is considered. Transmission control experiments of influenza H1N1 are carried out based on a modular and hierarchical network model. Results obtained indicate that hierarchical structure of the network is more critical than the degrees of the immunized targets and the modular network layer is the most important for the epidemic propagation control.

With a return to conventional practice, we now must create a research and policy agenda using the changes wrought by COVID-19 to help create a better health care system in its aftermath. The purpose of this study was to assess satisfaction of otolaryngology outpatient visits during the pandemic. METHODS: A prospective survey study was performed on caregivers of all patients ages 0–26 years old seen in the Division of Pediatric Otolaryngology at our large tertiary care children's hospital from February–April 2020. The three study groups were those seen in-person 6 weeks before telemedicine was implemented (IBTM), those seen in telemedicine during the first 6 weeks (TM) it was implemented at our hospital, and those seen in-person during the telemedicine period (IDTM) in the same timeframe. The survey consisted of satisfaction questions related to their visit, if their child was recommended surgery at the time of the visit, and if the caregiver agreed with the recommendation. A medical record review was also performed. RESULTS: A total of 176 caregivers completed the survey with 113(64.2%) completing the survey for an IBTM appointment, 59(33.5%) for a TM appointment, and 4(2.3%) for an IDTM appointment. There were 100(56.8%) male patients and 167(94.9%) were white. Families gave a higher response for the statement “The ability to communicate with the physician” (p = .012) and “The overall outpatient experience” (p = .004) in the IBTM cohort compared to the TM group. There were no significant differences for the other statements regarding the ability to understand recommendations, courtesy, and knowledge of the physician. Regardless of group, 98.6% of caregivers agreed with surgical recommendation when surgery was recommended. However, when surgery was not recommended at the appointment, caregivers were 11x more likely to disagree with the surgical recommendations, OR:11.49,95%CI:1.44–91.38,p = .005. CONCLUSION: We conclude that telemedicine was equally well received by patients as compared to traditional live assessments suggesting that virtual care is a viable post-pandemic paradigm change. Satisfaction was rated as “Good” or “Excellent”, however, messaging when surgery is not recommended was less acceptable and must be improved to obtain increased caregivers’ agreement in an era of shared decision making.",2021-12-28,"McCoy, Jennifer L.; Shaffer, Amber D.; Dohar, Joseph E.",Int J Pediatr Otorhinolaryngol,,document_parses/pdf_json/9640b00e5c8eab8b353ac39671b0094e0aecea0e.json; document_parses/pdf_json/35fa3959e62398a2f528628c9952d77d0317756a.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587621004079?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2021.111014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34974276/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165587621004079,245512426.0,2021,379

Exploring the influencing factors and possible adverse consequences of albumin reduction may provide some guidance for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this multicentre retrospective study, we collected information including demographics, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, complications, laboratory tests, treatment, and outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from three hospitals in Wuhan, China. We compared the indexes between patients with hypoalbuminemia and normal albumin. Regression model was used to evaluate various influencing factors of patients with hypoalbuminemia and their relationship with clinical outcomes. We also compared the changes of particular laboratory indexes in patients with hypoalbuminemia before and after enteral nutrition therapy. RESULTS: A total of 482 patients were enrolled in the study. About 53.7% patients developed hypoalbuminemia during admission. Patients with hypoalbuminemia were older, had a higher proportion of combined diabetes mellitus, fever, dyspnea, and natriuresis, and had a relatively poorer prognosis than patients with normal albumin. Patients with hypoalbuminemia had higher levels of CRP, leukocytes, ALT, AST, total bilirubin, ALP, GGT, LDH, creatine kinase, D-dimer, globulin, and lower levels of lymphocytes and eosinophils. Severe, older, anorexia, elevated CRP, and decreased lymphocytes were the independent predictors for decreased albumin in COVID-19 patients. In addition, decreased albumin is correlated with adverse outcomes. Nutritional support therapy to correct serum albumin may improve patient outcomes. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with hypoalbuminemia tend to have more severe clinical manifestations and more abnormal biochemical tests, which may result in poorer clinical outcomes.

This exacerbated hospital-centrism, to the detriment of PHC and Home Care, is showing a high contagion in healthcare professionals. The circulation of professionals in the hospitals, where the main focus of infection is concentrated, and from these to their homes is a clear risk factor. In addition, we must not forget that Home Care is of special importance for the care of people with terminal illnesses or very advanced chronic diseases (dementia, COPD ...), although always taking into account recommendations tending to extreme precautions for infection for professionals, family and caregivers.

Using data available up to 28 June 2021, the estimated additional deaths from a mitigation strategy are 1,750 to 4,600, implying a Cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year saved by locking down in March 2020 of at least 13 times the generally employed threshold figure of $62,000 for health interventions in New Zealand; the lockdowns do not then seem to have been justified by reference to the standard benchmark. Using only data available to the New Zealand government in March 2020, the ratio is similar and therefore the same conclusion holds that the nation-wide lockdown strategy was not warranted. Looking forwards from 28 June 2021, if a new outbreak occurs that cannot be suppressed without a nation-wide lockdown, the death toll from adopting a mitigation strategy at this point would be even less than had it done so in March 2020, due to the vaccination campaign and because the period over which the virus would then inflict casualties would now be much less than the period from March 2020; this would favour a mitigation policy even more strongly than in March 2020.

Physical education teachers faced an additional challenge, given the experiential nature of their subject, but research on teachers’ perspectives is scarce. This study aims to explore high school physical education teachers’ perceptions of the potential, advantages, and disadvantages of the blended learning model of instruction. An online survey was used to register the views of 174 Spanish high school physical education teachers (120 men and 54 women). The main findings revealed that physical education teachers considered that blended learning, compared with full face-to-face learning, implied a work overload, worsened social relationships, and did not help to increase students’ motivation. Likewise, most teachers considered the physical activity performed by students during the blended learning period as being lower than usual. Furthermore, teachers reported that the students from lower-income families were the ones that experienced a lack of technological means the most.

Here we analyse an extended SEIR model that accounts for asymptomatic carriers, believed to play an important role in COVID-19 transmission. For this model we derive a number of analytic results for important quantities such as the peak number of infections, the time taken to reach the peak and the size of the final affected population. We also propose an accurate way of specifying initial conditions for the numerics (from insufficient data) using the fact that the early time exponential growth is well-described by the dominant eigenvector of the linearized equations. Secondly we explore the effect of different intervention strategies such as social distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive number, [Formula: see text] to a target value [Formula: see text] but in distinct ways, which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same [Formula: see text] TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than SD. However, for TQ to be effective, it has to be based on contact tracing and our study quantifies the required ratio of tests-per-day to the number of new cases-per-day.

OBJECTIVE: This international, randomized 2 : 1, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study in patients ≥4 – < 8 years old with DMD due to any dystrophin mutation examined the effect of edasalonexent (100 mg/kg/day) compared to placebo over 52 weeks. METHODS: Endpoints were changes in the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA; primary) and timed function tests (TFTs; secondary). Assessment of health-related function used the Pediatric Outcomes Data Collection tool (PODCI). RESULTS: One hundred thirty one patients received edasalonexent (n = 88) and placebo (n = 43). At week 52, differences between edasalonexent and placebo for NSAA total score and TFTs were not statistically significant, although there were consistently less functional declines in the edasalonexent group. A pre-specified analysis by age demonstrated that younger patients (≤6.0 years) showed more robust and statistically significant differences between edasalonexent and placebo for some assessments. Treatment was well-tolerated and the majority of adverse events were mild, and most commonly involved the gastrointestinal system (primarily diarrhea). CONCLUSIONS: Edasalonexent was generally well-tolerated with a manageable safety profile at the dose of 100 mg/kg/day. Although edasalonexent did not achieve statistical significance for improvement in primary and secondary functional endpoints for assessment of DMD, subgroup analysis suggested that edasalonexent may slow disease progression if initiated before 6 years of age.

Therefore, it is important to promote the release of osteogenic/angiogenic growth factors. Since the discovery of heparin, its anticoagulant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer functions have been extensively studied for over a century. Although the application of heparin is widely used in the orthopedic field, its auxiliary effect on bone regeneration is yet to be unveiled. Specifically, approximately one-third of the transforming growth factor (TGF) superfamily is bound to heparin and heparan sulfate, among which TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) are the most common growth factors used. In addition, heparin can also improve the delivery and retention of BMP-2 in vivo promoting the healing of large bone defects at hyper physiological doses. In blood vessel formation, heparin still plays an integral part of fracture healing by cooperating with the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Importantly, since heparin binds to growth factors and release components in nanomaterials, it can significantly facilitate the controlled release and retention of growth factors [such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), BMP, and PDGF] in vivo. Consequently, the knowledge of scaffolds or delivery systems composed of heparin and different biomaterials (including organic, inorganic, metal, and natural polymers) is vital for material-guided bone regeneration research.

To date, little is known about the cause, clinical associations, and trajectory of “Long COVID”. METHODS: Participants of an outpatient clinical trial of Peginterferon-Lambda as treatment for uncomplicated SARS-CoV-2 infection were invited to long term follow-up visits 4, 7, and 10 months after initial COVID-19 diagnosis. Ongoing symptoms and functional impairment measures (work productivity and activity index (WPAI), NIH toolbox smell test, 6-minute walk test) were assessed and blood samples obtained. “Long COVID” was defined as presence of 2 or more typical symptoms (fatigue, hyposmia/hypogeusia, dyspnea, cough, palpitations, memory problems, joint pain) at follow up. Associations between baseline characteristics, initial COVID-19 clinical course, and presence of “Long COVID” during follow-up were assessed using generalized estimating equations accounting for repeated measurements within individuals. RESULTS: Eighty-seven participants returned for at least one follow-up visit. At four months, 29 (34.1%) had “Long COVID”; 19 (24.7%) met criteria at 7 months and 18 (23.4%) at 10 months (Figure 1). Presence of “Long COVID” symptoms did not correlate significantly with functional impairment measures. Female gender (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.37-6.61) and having gastrointestinal symptoms during acute COVID-19 illness (OR 5.37, 95% CI 1.02-28.18) were associated with “Long COVID” during follow-up (Figure 2).

Methods This placebo-controlled, randomized, adaptive, platform trial conducted among symptomatic Brazilian adults confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 included eligible patients with a known risk factor for progression to severe disease. Patients were randomly assigned to either fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) or placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome of emergency room observation for >6 hours or hospitalization from COVID-19 up to 28 days post randomization. Secondary outcomes included viral clearance at day 7, time to hospitalization, mortality, and adverse drug reactions. We used a Bayesian analytic framework to determine effects along with probability of success of intervention compared to placebo. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04727424) and is ongoing. Results The study team screened 9020 potential participants for this trial. The trial was initiated on June 2, 2020, with the current protocol reporting randomization from January 15, 2021 to August 6th 2021, when the trial arms were stopped for superiority. A total of 3238 patients were allocated to fluvoxamine (n=739), placebo (n=733) and other treatments (n=1766). Herein, we report the effectiveness of fluvoxamine vs. a concurrent placebo control. The average age of participants was 50 years (range 18-102 years); 57% were female. The proportion of patients observed in an emergency room for >6 hours or admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 was lower for the fluvoxamine group compared to placebo (77/739 vs 108/733; Relative Risk [RR]: 0.71; 95% Bayesian Credible Interval [95% BCI]: 0.54 - 0.93), with a probability of superiority of 99.4% surpassing the prespecified superiority threshold of 97.6% (risk difference 4.3%). Of the composite primary outcome events, 88% were hospitalizations. We found no significant relative effects between the fluvoxamine and placebo groups on viral clearance at day 7 (Odds ratio [OR]: 0.75; 95% Confidence Intervals [95% CI]: 0.53 - 1.07), mortality (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.36 - 1.30), time to death (Hazard ratio [HR]: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.58 - 1.08), days hospitalized (Mean Difference (MD) 1.22 days; 95% CI: 0.98 - 1.53), number of days ventilated (MD 1.10; 95% CI: 0.70 - 1.73) or other secondary outcomes. Data capturing all 28 days of follow-up will be reported after August 26th, 2021. Conclusions Treatment with fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) among high-risk outpatients with early diagnosed COVID-19, reduced the need for extended emergency room observation or hospitalization.

We aimed to evaluate clinical features and antibody mediated immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in subjects with autoimmune disease, compared to those without. Methods Patients who developed COVID-19 were identified through the audit department/clinician identification. In total, there were 48 subjects with autoimmune disease and confirmed COVID-19. Of these patients, 6 had sadly died. In recruited patients, clinical data regarding COVID-19 symptoms, treatment and outcomes were collected. Blood was taken for quantitative serology testing against SARS-CoV-2 using the Mologic test kit. A binary logistic regression was used to compare serology results in subjects with and without autoimmune diagnoses. Results Our sample included 103 participants. 26 subjects with autoimmune disease and confirmed COVID-19 were recruited, the most common diagnoses being rheumatoid arthritis (27%), psoriatic arthritis (19%) and inflammatory bowel disease (15%). 21 of 28 participants were on immunomodulatory medications including 16 on conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), four on biologic DMARDs and one on tacrolimus. We age- and gender-matched these subjects to 26 without autoimmune disease with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 17 further subjects reported viral-symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic but had negative serology. 30 subjects had rheumatic conditions but denied symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. 4 of the asymptomatic patients tested positive for COVID-19 on serology. 23 stored serum samples, obtained before 2019, were all negative for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. In patients with confirmed COVID-19, clinical features and serology were compared in those with and without autoimmune disease. Logistic regression showed a significant impact of COVID-19 severity on antibody titres in people with and without autoimmune disease (p = 0.003 and <0.001 respectively). In both mild and severe disease, autoimmunity had no effect on antibody titres (p = 0.253 and 0.119 respectively). Conclusion People with and without autoimmune disease presented with similar symptoms of COVID-19. In our sample, subjects with autoimmune disease were less likely to be hospitalised or require respiratory support. Serology revealed no difference in antibody titres against SARS-CoV-2 in participants with and without autoimmune disease. Disclosure K. Biddle: None. S. Koushesh: None. D. Clark: None. S.

METHODS In this prospective cohort study we evaluated patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were consecutively admitted to a tertiary hospital and required OTI from March 1 to October 31, 2020. Patients discharged were called for outpatient follow-up and endoscopic examination. RESULTS A total of 1,357 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, as confirmed by nasal swab RT-PCR, were admitted. OTI for mechanical ventilation was required in 421 patients (31%). Of the intubated patients, 172 (40.9%) were discharged and 249 (59.1%) died. Outpatient evaluation by videoendoscopy was performed in 95 patients (55.2%) approximately 100 days after extubation. Laryngotracheal lesions were observed in 38 patients (40%), with 17.9% diagnosed with laryngotracheal stenosis or unilateral immobility while 6.3% had severe stenosis (grades 3 and 4). The factors presenting statistical significance for the development of laryngotracheal lesions were the endotracheal tube size, prone position over the OTI period, and the increased leukocyte count, D-dimer, prothrombin time (PT), and international normalized ratio (INR) on the day OTI was performed. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of laryngotracheal lesion in COVID-19 patients is 40%, with 6.3% of them presenting with severe stenosis. There was a greater risk for the development of laryngotracheal lesions in patients using a larger endotracheal tube, kept in a prone position, presenting a greater inflammatory reaction (increased leukocyte count), or developing coagulation disorders (increased D-dimer, PT, and INR).

Except representative manifestation of pneumonia and acute respiratory symptoms, COVID-19 patients have also shown different levels of liver injury or liver dysfunction. The aim of our study was to explore the probable clinical severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients and their liver dysfunction. METHOD: A combination of computer and manual retrieval was used to search in Medline through PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science. Review Manager 5.3 software was used to examine the heterogeneity among the studies and to calculate the combined effect value (OR, 95CI). Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and publication bias test were also performed. RESULTS: We found a significant connection between liver dysfunction and mortality of COVID-19 patients with a pooled OR of 1.98 (95% CI 1.39–2.82; P = 0.0002). There was a significant association between AST and severity of COVID-19 with a pooled OR of 4.48 (95% CI 3.24–7.21; P < 0.001), and a pooled WMD of 3.35 (95% CI, 2.07 to 4.64; P < 0.001). In addition, there was a significant difference between TBIL and severity of COVID-19, with a pooled OR of 1.91 (95% CI 1.40–2.60; P < 0.001), and with a pooled WMD of 1.18 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.58; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The mortality and severity of COVID-19 patients are significantly associated with liver dysfunction.

Suicidal ideation was assessed using item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. The prevalence of suicidal ideation and its risk factors was evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 56,679 participants (27,149 males and 29,530 females) were included. The overall prevalence of suicidal ideation was 16.4%, including 10.9% seldom, 4.1% often, and 1.4% always suicidal ideation. The prevalence of suicidal ideation was higher in males (19.1%) and individuals aged 18–24 years (24.7%) than in females (14.0%) and those aged 45 years and older (11.9%). Suicidal ideation was more prevalent in individuals with suspected or confirmed infection (63.0%), frontline workers (19.2%), and people with pre-existing mental disorders (41.6%). Experience of quarantine, unemployed, and increased psychological stress during the pandemic were associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation and its severity.

To systematically understand human genetic contributions to respiratory virus infection, we developed the database dbGSRV, a manually curated database that integrated the host genetic susceptibility and severity studies of respiratory viruses scattered over literatures in PubMed. At present, dbGSRV contains 1932 records of genetic association studies relating 1010 unique variants and seven respiratory viruses, manually curated from 168 published articles. Users can access the records by quick searching, batch searching, advanced searching and browsing. Reference information, infection status, population information, mutation information and disease relationship are provided for each record, as well as hyper links to public databases in convenient of users accessing more information. In addition, a visual overview of the topological network relationship between respiratory viruses and associated genes is provided.

METHODS: Two nursing homes were hospital-dependent, had connections with infection prevention and control departments, and had permanent physicians. Third nursing home had no direct connection with general hospital, no infection control practitioner, and no permanent physician. The main outcome was death. RESULTS: During first 3 months of the outbreak, 224/375 (59.7%) residents were classified “COVID-19 cases” and 57/375 (15.2%) died. Hospital dependent nursing homes had lower COVID-19 case fatality rates in comparison to non-hospital dependent nursing home (15 [6.6%] vs 38 [25.8%], OR 0.20 [0.11-0.38], p = 0.001). During first 3 weeks of the outbreak, mortality in COVID-19 patients decreased if they had daily clinical examination (aOR: 0.09 [0.03-0.35], p = 0.01), 3 vital signs measurements per day (OR: 0.06 [0.01-0.30], p = 0.001) and prophylactic anticoagulation (OR: 0 [0.00-0.24], p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that high mortality rates in some nursing homes during COVID-19 outbreak might be favoured by a lack of medical care management.

Local cycles of transmission have already occurred in 12 countries after case importation. In Africa, Egypt has so far confirmed one case. The management and control of COVID-19 importations heavily rely on a country's health capacity. Here we evaluate the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries against their risk of importation of COVID-19. METHODS: We used data on the volume of air travel departing from airports in the infected provinces in China and directed to Africa to estimate the risk of importation per country. We determined the country's capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, using the WHO International Health Regulations Monitoring and Evaluation Framework; and vulnerability, using the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions contributing most to their risk. FINDINGS: Countries with the highest importation risk (ie, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) have moderate to high capacity to respond to outbreaks. Countries at moderate risk (ie, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability. We identified three clusters of countries that share the same exposure to the risk originating from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and the city of Beijing, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Many countries in Africa are stepping up their preparedness to detect and cope with COVID-19 importations. Resources, intensified surveillance, and capacity building should be urgently prioritised in countries with moderate risk that might be ill-prepared to detect imported cases and to limit onward transmission.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an online experiment with 371 participants who viewed a COVID-19 screening session between a hotline agent (chatbot or human) and a user with mild or severe symptoms. RESULTS: The primary factor driving user response to screening hotlines (human or chatbot) is perceptions of the agent’s ability. When ability is the same, users view chatbots no differently or more positively than human agents. The primary factor driving perceptions of ability is the user’s trust in the hotline provider, with a slight negative bias against chatbots’ ability. Asians perceived higher ability and benevolence than Whites.

Compared to the systems established by several countries that submit common law systems in which dispute-solving cases are terminated by the special courts called Small Claims Courts or Small Claims Tribunals, CDRB construction in Indonesia was quite vague. Although it uses arbitration terminology, the CDRB lacks an arbitration mechanism because, in practice, the body examines consumer disputes, working formally as a court. The root of this problem arose from the inconsistent regulation in the CPA. This article aims to review the CDRB construction problem compared to systems in other countries, to find recommendations for CPA amendments and discuss the future prospects. This study suggests two solutions: The first is the strict separation of litigation and non-litigation dispute resolution. The second is the formation of both online litigation and non-litigation systems.

Currently, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) versus this virus are expected to correlate with recovery and protection of this disease. However, the characteristics of these antibodies have not been well studied in association with the clinical manifestations in patients. Methods Plasma collected from 175 COVID-19 recovered patients with mild symptoms were screened using a safe and sensitive pseudotyped-lentiviral-vector-based neutralization assay. Spike-binding antibody in plasma were determined by ELISA using RBD, S1, and S2 proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The levels and the time course of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs and the spike-binding antibodies were monitored at the same time. Findings SARS-CoV-2 NAbs were unable to cross-reactive with SARS-CoV virus. SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs were detected in patients from day 10-15 after the onset of the disease and remained thereafter. The titers of NAb among these patients correlated with the spike-binding antibodies targeting S1, RBD, and S2 regions. The titers of NAbs were variable in different patients. Elderly and middle-age patients had significantly higher plasma NAb titers (P<0.0001) and spike-binding antibodies (P=0.0003) than young patients. Notably, among these patients, there were ten patients whose NAb titers were under the detectable level of our assay (ID50: < 40); while in contrast, two patients, showed very high titers of NAb, with ID50 :15989 and 21567 respectively. The NAb titers were positive correlated with plasma CRP levels but negative correlated with the lymphocyte counts of patients at the time of admission, indicating an association between humoral response and cellular immune response. Interpretation The variations of SARS-CoV-2 specific NAbs in recovered COVID-19 patients may raise the concern about the role of NAbs on disease progression. The correlation of NAb titers with age, lymphocyte counts, and blood CRP levels suggested that the interplay between virus and host immune response in coronavirus infections should be further explored for the development of effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Furthermore, titration of NAb is helpful prior to the use of convalescent plasma for prevention or treatment.

As a result, federated networks have arisen, which allow simultaneously querying medical databases at a group of connected institutions. The most basic such query is the aggregate count—e.g. How many patients have diabetes? However, depending on the protocol used to estimate that total, there is always a tradeoff in the accuracy of the estimate against the risk of leaking confidential data. Prior work has shown that it is possible to empirically control that tradeoff by using the HyperLogLog (HLL) probabilistic sketch.

Statistical analysis was performed from January to February 2021. EXPOSURE: In-person or remote ambulatory cardiology clinic visit at one of 31 during the pre-COVID period or COVID-era period. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Comparison of patient characteristics and frequencies of medication ordering and cardiology-specific testing across 4 visit types (pre-COVID in-person (reference), COVID-era in-person, COVID-era video, COVID-era telephone).

This novel virus is diagnosed utilising a conventional method known as the RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) test. This approach, however, produces a lot of false-negative and erroneous outcomes. According to recent studies, COVID-19 can also be diagnosed using X-rays, CT scans, blood tests and cough sounds. In this article, we use blood tests and machine learning to predict the diagnosis of this deadly virus. We also present an extensive review of various existing machine-learning applications that diagnose COVID-19 from clinical and laboratory markers. Four different classifiers along with a technique called Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) were used for classification. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method was utilized to calculate the gravity of each feature and it was found that eosinophils, monocytes, leukocytes and platelets were the most critical blood parameters that distinguished COVID-19 infection for our dataset. These classifiers can be utilized in conjunction with RT-PCR tests to improve sensitivity and in emergency situations such as a pandemic outbreak that might happen due to new strains of the virus. The positive results indicate the prospective use of an automated framework that could help clinicians and medical personnel diagnose and screen patients.

In order to reduce this percentage, physicians should establish clear and objective criteria to stratify COVID‐19 patients at high risk of in‐hospital death. Thus, the aim has been to test a large spectrum of variables ranging from clinical evaluation to laboratory biomarkers to identify which parameter would best predict all‐cause in‐hospital mortality in COVID‐19 patients. DESIGN: observational study. RESULTS: Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that each 5 years of increase in age corresponded to a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.28 (95% CI 1.00‐1.65, P = .050); each increment of 803 ng/L of N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP) corresponded to a HR of 1.24 (95% CI 1.11‐1.39, P < .001); each increment of 58 ng/L of interleukin (IL)‐6 corresponded to a HR of 1.23 (95% CI 1.09‐1.40, P < .001), and each increment of 250 U/L of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) corresponded to a HR of 1.23 (95% CI 1.10‐1.37, P < .001). According to the calculated cut‐points for age (≥70 years), NT‐proBNP (≥803 ng/L), IL‐6 (≥58 ng/L) and LDH (≥371 U/L) when 2 out of these 4 were overcome, the HR was 2.96 (95% CI 1.97‐4.45, P < .001).

Providing health interventions via digital modes of delivery can extend the reach of programs delivered through traditional means. The web-based version of the Diabetes Education and Self-Management for Ongoing and Newly Diagnosed (MyDESMOND) is a digital diabetes education and support program for people with type 2 diabetes. The program was originally developed in the United Kingdom and is evidence-based, grounded in behavioral theory, and designed through a rigorous process of intervention mapping. As such, MyDESMOND was considered an ideal candidate for adaptation to the Australian setting. Program content and the digital platform were modified to suit the local context to increase the likelihood that the revised version of MyDESMOND will deliver similar outcomes to the original program. The aim of this paper is to describe the systematic processes undertaken to adapt the digital MyDESMOND diabetes education and support program for people with type 2 diabetes to the Australian setting. The adaptation involved a multidisciplinary group with a diverse range of skills and expertise—a governance structure was established, a skilled project team was appointed, and stakeholder engagement was strategically planned. The adaptation of the program content included modifications to the clinical recommendations, the inclusion of local resources, practical changes, and revisions to optimize readability. A 2-stage independent review of the modified content was enacted. Digital adaptations were informed by relevant standards, local legislative requirements, and considerations of data sovereignty. The digital platform was extensively tested before deployment to the production setting. MyDESMOND is the first evidence-based digital diabetes education and support program for Australians with type 2 diabetes.

Whether the pandemic could change the association between cold temperature and mortality remains unknown. Objectives: We aimed to assess whether the association between cold temperature and all-cause mortality in the pandemic period has changed compared to non-COVID-19 period (2015-2019) in Italy. Methods: We collected daily all-cause mortality data and meteorological data for 107 Italian provinces from 1, January 2015 to 31, May 2020. A time-stratified case-crossover design with the distributed lag non-linear model was used to examine the association between cold temperature and all-cause mortality during the first three months (from March to May in 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak and the same months in 2015-2019. Results: The relative risk (RR) of all-cause mortality at extreme cold temperature (2.5th percentile of temperature at 3 {degrees}C) in comparison with the minimum mortality temperature (24 {degrees}C) was 4.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.90-5.79] in the pandemic period, which is more than triple higher than RR [1.41 (95%CI: 1.33-1.50)] in the same months during 2015-2019. The shift in cold-mortality association was particularly significant for people aged 65-74 years [RR (95%CI): 5.98 (3.78-9.46) in 2020 versus 1.29 (1.10-1.51) in 2015-2019], 75-84 years [5.25 (3.79-7.26) versus 1.40 (1.25-1.56)], and [≥] 85 years [5.03 (3.90-6.51) versus 1.52 (1.39-1.66)], but not significant for those aged 0-64 years [1.95 (1.17-3.24) versus 1.24 (1.05-1.48)].

The infant immune system differs from that of older children and adults in many ways that are as yet ill understood. We have used a C57BL/6 mouse model of infection with a laboratory- adapted strain of influenza (PR8) to delineate the importance of the cytokine IL-6 in the innate response to primary infection and in the development of protective immunity in adult mice. Herein, we used this same model in infant (14 days of age) mice to determine the effect of IL-6 deficiency. Infant wild type mice are more susceptible than older mice to infection, similar to the findings in humans. IL-6 is expressed in the lung in the early response to PR8 infection. While intramuscular immunization does not protect against lethal challenge, intranasal administration of heat inactivated virus is protective and correlates with expression of IL-6 in the lung, activation of lung CD8 cells, and development of an influenza-specific antibody response. In IL-6 deficient mice, this response is abrogated, and deficient mice are not protected against lethal challenge.

DESIGN: Retrospective data extraction study from March 1, 2020, to June 7, 2020. Delirium outcomes were assessed for up to the first 14 days in ICU. SETTING: Two large, academic centers serving the state of Indiana. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients admitted to the ICU with positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 nasopharyngeal swab polymerase chain reaction test from March 1, 2020, to June 7, 2020, were included. Individuals younger than 18 years of age, without any delirium assessments, or without discharge disposition were excluded. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcomes were delirium rates and duration, and the secondary outcome was delirium severity. Two-hundred sixty-eight consecutive patients were included in the analysis with a mean age of 58.4 years (sd, 15.6 yr), 40.3% were female, 44.4% African American, 20.7% Hispanic, and a median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 18 (interquartile range, 13–25).

The detection limit of hypochlorite is 1.80 × 10(−4) M in solution, and the visual detection limit is 1.27 µg/cm(2) with the naked eye for the flexible paper-based chemosensor. The proposed flexible chemosensors show a good selectivity and sensitivity which has great potential for effective detection of hypochlorite anions without any spectroscopic instrumentation.",2021-12-03,"Wu, Qin; Tao, Tao; Zhao, Yunxia; Huang, Wei",Sensors (Basel),,document_parses/pdf_json/feaea13755886d997a2bec5a67eeee0c5648a801.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34884086/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21238082,244941454.0,2021,138

OBJECTIVES: To describe and compare clinical characteristics, management and outcomes of COVID-19 patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) in SA during the first and second waves. METHODS: In a prospective, single-centre, descriptive study, we compared all patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to ICU during the first and second waves. The primary outcomes assessed were ICU mortality and ICU length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: In 490 patients with comparable ages and comorbidities, no difference in mortality was demonstrated during the second compared with the first wave (65.9% v. 62.5%, p=0.57). ICU LOS was longer in the second wave (10 v. 6 days, p<0.001).

Recently, there has been growing insight into the biological functions of NK cells, in particular into their roles in infection, tumorurveillance and autoimmunity. Under these pathophysiological circumstances, NK cells readily home to the central nervous system (CNS) tissues to combat infection and presumably to curb progression of tumor. Bystander neuronal and/or glial cell damage can occur in this setting. Paradoxically, NK cells appear to have an inhibitory role for autoimmune responses within the CNS. As in the periphery, NK cells act in concert with T cells and other lymphocytes responsible for CNS pathology and immune regulation. Insights into the molecular signals and pathways governing the diverse biological effects of NK cells are keys for designing NK cell-based therapy for CNS infections, tumor and autoimmune diseases.NK cells readily accumulate in homing to CNS tissues under the pathophysiological situations. This process is tightly controlled by a number of chemokines and chemokine receptors. There is ample of evidence that NK cells within the CNS contribute to the control of infections and might limit progression of certain tumor. Bystander neuronal and/or glial cell damage can occur. In certain autoimmune conditions of the CNS, NK cells appear to have an inhibitory role. Disassociation of disease-inhibiting versus disease-promoting effects of NK cells is a key to harnessing NK cells for therapeutic purposes.

An increasing number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRs/MAs) have begun to investigate the effects of TC on balance function in stroke patients. The aim of this current study was to systematically collate, appraise, and synthesize the results of these SRs/MAs using a systematic overview. METHODS: Eight databases were searched: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, CNKI, SinoMed, Chongqing VIP, and Wanfang Data. SRs/MAs of TC on balance function in stroke patients were included. Literature selection, data extraction, and assessment of the review quality were performed by two independent reviewers. Methodological quality was assessed by the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2), reporting quality by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), and evidence quality by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). RESULTS: Nine SRs/MAs were included in this study. For methodological quality, what resulted in unsatisfactory methodological quality was noncompliance with critical item 4 (using a comprehensive literature search strategy) and critical item 7 (providing the list of excluded research literature). For reporting quality, what resulted in unsatisfactory reporting quality was inadequate reporting of Q1 (protocol and registration), Q8 (search), Q15 (risk of bias across studies), Q16 (additional analyses), Q22 (risk of bias across studies), Q23 (additional analysis), and Q27 (funding). For GRADE, the evidence quality was high in 0, moderate in 3, low in 11, and very low in 6. Risk of bias was the most common factor leading to downgrading of evidence, followed by inconsistency, imprecision, publication bias, and indirectness. CONCLUSIONS: TC may have beneficial effects on balance function in stroke survivors; however, this finding is limited by the generally low methodology, reporting quality, and evidence quality for published SRs/MAs.",2022-03-09,"Hu, Caixia; Qin, Xiaohui; Jiang, Minqing; Tan, Miaoqing; Liu, Shuying; Lu, Yuhua; Lin, Changting; Ye, Richun",Neural Plast,,document_parses/pdf_json/f68e122d70346e3dca34d1a24e5979497e92b493.json,https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/3895514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35309256/,247403403.0,2022,297

Multiple pathogenetic mechanisms for thrombosis have been implicated, including endothelial dysfunction, increased von Willebrand factor (vWF), interleukin-6 release, and activation of/interaction between macrophages, monocytes, endothelial cells, platelets and lymphocytes. The actual rate of arterial and venous thromboembolic events (ATE and VTE) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, especially in the immediate post-hospital discharge period, has not been fully elucidated, with most of the data derived from retrospective studies with small sample sizes. Methods Against this background, we have designed and implemented an ongoing prospective registry (CORE-19) consisting of 11,249 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from March 1st 2020 through May 31st 2020 using data derived from the Northwell Health System and the COVID-19 Research Consortium to study through 90-days post-discharge the rate of VTE and ATE, major bleeding, all-cause mortality, and other complications. We are capturing data of interest including demographic characteristics, co-morbidities, relevant medications, hospital setting, in-hospital treatment, thromboprophylaxis usage, key laboratory parameters, and 90-day thromboembolic and other key outcomes. A unified data repository (datamart) of hospitalized COVID-19 patients across multiple datasets from electronic health records, health informatics exchange, a dedicated radiology database, and a standardized data collection tool in REDCap, that includes telephonic calls up to 90 days post-discharge, is being implemented. A common data model (CDM) is utilized to ensure semantic interoperability between data originating from disparate sources. Northwell Health protocols stipulate the use of post-discharge low-molecular weight heparin, direct oral anticoagulants, or baby aspirin in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with high thrombotic risk features. Results Our cohort as of August 7, 2020 consists of complete follow up in 4,100 patients with a mean age of 61.0 years (SD: 17.0) with 54.7% males (Table 1). Preliminary data show an all-cause mortality rate of 4.29%, an overall thromboembolic rate of 3.51% (2.41% VTE and 1.10% ATE), a major bleeding rate of 1.61%, and a rehospitalization rate of 12.85%. Of patients with either DVT or PE post-discharge, 13.43% (9/67) died. The full dataset, including risk factors, comorbidities, key in-hospital and post-discharge medications including anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents, will be available at the time of presentation to the ASH congress. Conclusion Our ongoing registry is a large prospective study evaluating the rate of overall thromboembolic complications and all-cause mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients through 90 days post discharge. Current rates of thromboembolic events signify the importance of post-discharge surveillance and, potentially, post-discharge extended thromboprophylaxis, in this acutely ill medical population.

CR3022 is a SARS-CoV neutralizing antibody to a highly conserved epitope on the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein that can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2, but with lower affinity. Using x-ray crystallography, mutagenesis, and binding experiments, we illustrate that of four amino acid differences in the CR3022 epitope between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, a single mutation P384A fully determines the affinity difference. CR3022 does not neutralize SARS-CoV-2, but the increased affinity to SARS-CoV-2 P384A mutant now enables neutralization with a similar potency to SARS-CoV. We further investigated CR3022 interaction with the SARS-CoV spike protein by negative-stain EM and cryo-EM. Three CR3022 Fabs bind per trimer with the RBD observed in different up-conformations due to considerable flexibility of the RBD.

This paper investigates the impact of this disruption on the achieved progress towards the WHO 2030 target for STH. Methods We used two stochastic individual-based models to simulate the impact of missing one or more preventive chemotherapy (PC) rounds in different endemicity settings. We also investigate the extent to which the impact can be lessened by mitigation strategies, such as semi-annual or community-wide PC. Results Both models show that even without a mitigation strategy, control programmes will catch up by 2030. The catch-up time is limited to a maximum of 4.5 years after the interruption. Mitigations strategies may reduce this catch-up time by up to two years and can even increase the probability of achieving the 2030 target. Conclusions Though a PC interruption will only temporarily impact the progress towards the WHO 2030 target, programmes are encouraged to restart as soon as possible to minimise the impact on morbidity. The implementation of suitable mitigation strategies can turn the interruption into an opportunity to accelerate the progress toward reaching the target.",2020-11-04,"Malizia, V.; Giardina, F.; Vegvari, C.; Bajaj, S.; McRae-McKee, K.; Anderson, R.

Among these, the glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) system is the most effective. However, the precise mechanism of GAD induction is unknown. We previously reported that a tolC mutant lacking the TolC outer membrane channel was defective in GAD induction. Here, we show that indole, a substrate of TolC-dependent efflux pumps and produced by the tryptophanase encoded by the tnaA gene, negatively regulates GAD expression. GAD expression was restored by deleting tnaA in the tolC mutant; in wild-type E. coli, it was suppressed by adding indole to the growth medium. RNA-sequencing revealed that tnaA mRNA levels drastically decreased upon exposure to moderately acidic conditions (pH 5.5). This decrease was suppressed by RNase E deficiency. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the RNase E-dependent degradation of tnaA mRNA is accelerated upon acid exposure, which decreases intracellular indole concentrations and triggers GAD induction.",2020-04-28,"Kanda, Takeshi; Abiko, Genta; Kanesaki, Yu; Yoshikawa, Hirofumi; Iwai, Noritaka; Wachi, Masaaki",Scientific reports,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63981-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346014/,216560568.0,2020,161

Governments, statistics agencies, and health care organizations are developing and implementing modernized practices that support health equity for SGMs. Extending our work, we conducted a rapid review of grey literature to explore information practices that support quality health care for SGMs. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this rapid review of grey literature was to elucidate modern GSSO information practices from leading agencies for adaptation, adoption, and application by health care providers and organizations seeking to modernize outdated GSSO information practices that contribute to health inequities among SGMs. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and Google from 2015 to 2020 with terms related to gender, sex, sexual orientation, and electronic health/medical records for English-language grey literature resources including government and nongovernment organization publications, whitepapers, data standards, toolkits, health care organization and health quality practice and policy guides, conference proceedings, unpublished academic work, and statistical papers. Peer-reviewed journal articles were excluded, as were resources irrelevant to information practices. We also screened the reference sections of included articles for additional resources, and canvassed a working group of international topic experts for additional relevant resources. Duplicates were eliminated. ATLAS.ti was used to support analysis. Themes and codes were developed through an iterative process of writing and discussion with the research team. RESULTS: Twenty-six grey literature resources met the inclusion criteria. The overarching themes that emerged from the literature were the interrelated behaviors, attitudes, and policies that constitute SGM cultural competence as follows: shared language with unambiguous definitions of GSSO concepts; welcoming and inclusive care environments and affirming practices to reduce barriers to access; health care policy that supports competent health care; and adoption of modernized GSSO information practices and electronic health record design requirements that address invisibility in health data. CONCLUSIONS: Health equity for SGMs requires systemic change. Binary representation of sex and gender in electronic health records (EHRs) obfuscates natural and cultural diversity and, in the context of health care, places SGM patients at risk of clinical harm because it leads to clinical assumptions. Agencies and agents in health care need to be equipped with the knowledge and tools needed to cultivate modern attitudes, policies, and practices that enable health equity for SGMs. Adopting small but important changes in the language and terminology used in technical and social health care systems is essential for institutionalizing SGM competency.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effect of public health campaigns and the effect of socially communicated health information on learning about diseases simultaneously. Although extant literature addresses the effect of one source of information (official or social) or the other, it has not addressed the simultaneous interaction of official information (OI) and social information (SI) in an experimental setting. METHODS: We used a series of experiments that exposed participants to both OI and structured SI about the symptoms and spread of hepatitis C over a series of 10 rounds of computer-based interactions. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a high, low, or control intensity of OI and to receive accurate or inaccurate SI about the disease. RESULTS: A total of 195 participants consented to participate in the study. Of these respondents, 186 had complete responses across all ten experimental rounds, which corresponds to a 4.6% (9/195) nonresponse rate. The OI high intensity treatment increases learning over the control condition for all symptom and contagion questions when individuals have lower levels of baseline knowledge (all P values ≤.04). The accurate SI condition increased learning across experimental rounds over the inaccurate condition (all P values ≤.01). We find limited evidence of an interaction between official and SI about infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: This project demonstrates that exposure to official public health information increases individuals’ knowledge of the spread and symptoms of a disease. Socially shared information also facilitates the learning of accurate and inaccurate information, though to a lesser extent than exposure to OI. Although the effect of OI persists, preliminary results suggest that it can be degraded by persistent contradictory SI over time.",2021-11-23,"Assaf, Elias; Bond, Robert M; Cranmer, Skyler J; Kaizar, Eloise E; Ratliff Santoro, Lauren; Shikano, Susumu; Sivakoff, David J",J Med Internet Res,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34817389/; https://doi.org/10.2196/25287,238968509.0,2021,313

trv75evr,,Medline,Trends in Waste Production at a Community Hospital during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,,,34705906.0,unk,"INTRODUCTION As of September 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to 42,500,000 cases and 680,000 deaths in the United States. In Rhode Island, there have been 170,000 cases and 2,820 deaths. Investigating resource utilization and waste production during disease outbreaks can inform efforts at disaster preparedness. The purpose of this study was to examine trends in waste production during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This is a descriptive study examining trends in waste production during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted at a suburban community hospital in Rhode Island. Data was collected on regulated medical waste (RMW) and linen use from October 2019-July 2021. Adjusted patient days (APD) values were calculated using hospital census and revenue data. Total weight and weight/APD were calculated for each month of the study period. Data was then compared with overall COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Rhode Island. This data was gathered from the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) COVID Response Data Hub. RESULTS Regulated Medical Waste (RMW) by total weight was lowest in April 2020, when the hospital census and adjusted patient days (APD) were at their lowest. In contrast, linen use remained largely consistent with pre-pandemic levels during the initial months of the pandemic despite a decrease in hospital census. The highest linen weight/APD value (23.32 lbs/APD) was in April 2020. Both RMW and linen use (weight/APD) decreased during the study period. Linen use was highest during months with increased COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS This study examined trends in waste production at a community hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. Linen use was highest during months of increased COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations, while RMW production decreased. There was a particular increase in linen use in April 2020, when the pandemic was in its initial phases.",2021-11-01,"Martin, Kyle Denison; Chen, Jane J; Thorndike, Jamie; McCormick, Winston; Rota, John; Berg, Brian; Dulski, Annie",Rhode Island medical journal,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34705906/,240072158.0,2021,293

It was necessary to conduct the pre-clinical study because of its relevant curative properties. This study aimed to investigate in-vitro antioxidant, standardize quality parameters, study acute toxicity, and determine in-vivo anti-inflammatory. Three spectrophotometric methods were used to determine antioxidant activity. The standardization includes physical, chemical, and microbiological evaluation. Furthermore, an acute toxicity test was conducted using 20 female Sprague Dawley (SD) strain rats divided into 4 groups with different dose of propolis. The in vivo anti-inflammatory test was carried out using the carrageenan induction method on rats' soles. A total of 36 female SD rats were classified into 6 groups as follows, Group normal, negative control, diclofenac sodium, and three propolis groups (72; 144; and 288 mg/kg BW). The results demonstrated the IC(50) values of the DPPH and ABTS scavenging activity 9.694 ppm and 2.213 ppm, respectively. The FRAP reducing power was 189.05 mg AaE/g.

We investigated the role and underlying mechanism of sulfiredoxin-1 (Srxn1) in AP. Mild AP was induced by intraperitoneal injection of cerulein and severe AP was induced by partial duct ligation with cerulein stimulation or intraperitoneal injection of L-arginine in mice. Acinar cells, neutrophils, and macrophages were isolated. The pancreas was analyzed by histology, immunochemistry staining, and TUNEL assays, and the expression of certain proteins and RNAs, cytokine levels, trypsin activity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were determined. Srxn1 was inhibited by J14 or silenced by siRNA, and overexpression was introduced by a lentiviral vector. Transcriptomic analysis was used to explore the mechanism of Srxn1-mediated effects. We also evaluated the effect of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated overexpression of Srxn1 by intraductal administration and the protection of AP. We found that Srxn1 expression was upregulated in mild AP but decreased in severe AP. Inhibition of Srxn1 increased ROS, histological score, the release of trypsin, and inflammatory responses in mice. Inhibition of Srxn1 expression promoted the production of ROS and induced apoptosis, while overexpression of Srxn1 led to the opposite results in acinar cells. Furthermore, inhibition of Srxn1 expression promoted the inflammatory response by accumulating and activating M1 phenotype macrophages and neutrophils in AP. Mechanistically, ROS-induced ER stress and activation of Cathepsin B, which converts trypsinogen to trypsin, were responsible for the Srxn1 inhibition-mediated effects on AP. Importantly, we demonstrated that AAV-mediated overexpression of Srxn1 attenuated AP in mice. Taken together, these results showed that Srxn1 is a protective target for AP by attenuating acinar injury and inflammation through the ROS/ER stress/Cathepsin B axis.",2021-06-17,"He, Jun; Ma, Miaomiao; Li, Daming; Wang, Kunpeng; Wang, Qiuguo; Li, Qiuguo; He, Hongye; Zhou, Yan; Li, Qinglong; Hou, Xuyang; Yang, Leping",Cell death & disease,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-021-03923-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140464/,235473139.0,2021,275

In 177 COVID-19–associated deaths reported in Regensburg, Germany, from October 2020 to January 2021, we investigated how deaths following SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported and whether cases with a death attributed to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 death [CD]) differed from cases with a reported death from other causes (non–COVID-19 death [NCD]). STUDY DESIGN: This was an observational retrospective cohort study. METHODS: We analysed descriptive data on the numbers of cases, deaths, age, sex, symptoms and hospitalizations. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) and performed Chi-squared/Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for comparison of medians. RESULTS: Deaths attributed to COVID-19 occurred primarily in elderly patients. The mortality rate and the case fatality ratio (CFR) increased with age. The median age and the prevalence of risk factors were similar between CD and NCD. Respiratory symptoms and pneumonia at the time of diagnosis were associated with death reported as CD. The odds of CD attribution in cases hospitalized because of COVID-19 were 6-fold higher than the odds of NCD (OR: 6.00; 95% CI: 1.32 to 27.22). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory symptoms/pneumonia at the time of diagnosis and hospitalization due to COVID-19 were associated with attributing a death to COVID-19.

In settings of low disease prevalence, such as asymptomatic community testing, national guidelines recommend molecular confirmation of positive Ag-RDT results. This often requires patients to be recalled for repeat specimen recollection and subsequent testing in reference laboratories. This project assessed the use of a point-of-care molecular method for SARS-CoV-2 detection on-site at a volunteer-led asymptomatic community testing site, using the residual test buffer (RTB) from positive Ag-RDTs. Methods: The Abbott COVID-19 ID NOW assay was performed on RTB from two Ag-RDTs: the Abbott Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device and the BTNX Rapid Response COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Device. All RTBs were tested using real-time RT-PCR at a reference laboratory using the ThermoFisher TaqPath COVID-19 Combo kit which was used to assign positive Ag-RDTs results as true or false positives. Analytical specificity of the ID NOW was assessed with a panel of various respiratory organisms. Results: Of 419 positive Ag-RDTs from 5148 tests performed, ID NOW testing of the RTB was positive in 100% of the samples characterized as true positives by RT-PCR. No SARS-CoV-2 detections by ID NOW were observed from 10 specimens characterized as false positive Ag-RDTs, or from contrived specimens with various respiratory organisms. Conclusions: The use of on-site molecular testing on RTB provides a suitable option for rapid confirmatory testing of positive Ag-RDTs, thereby obviating the need for specimen recollection for molecular testing at local reference laboratories.",2022-02-24,"LeBlanc, J.

The end aim is to characterise the binding mode of CQ and HCQ and identify the key amino acid residues involved in the mechanism of action. Further, molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) were carried out with the docked complex to search for the conformational space and for understanding the integrity of binding mode. We showed that the CQ and HCQ can bind with better binding affinity with PLpro as compared to reference known PLpro inhibitor.

However, it remains unclear whether a common mechanism exists across different demographic characteristics. SARS-CoV-2 infection is initiated by the specific binding of the viral spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This study analyzed the demographics of pulmonary ACE2 expression, Mendelian randomization (MR) of ACE2 and COVID-19, and comparative tropism of SARS-CoV-2. The key features of SARS-CoV-2 tropism, including pulmonary ACE2 expression and ACE2-expressing cell types, showed distinct subphenotypes associated with the demographics of vulnerable COVID-19 populations, suggesting a hypothesis centered on “ACE2” to explain their interplay. Next, by integrating multiple COVID-19 cohorts of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) of ACE2, MR analysis demonstrated that ACE2 played a causal role in COVID-19 susceptibility and severity, suggesting ACE2 as a promising target for early COVID-19 treatment. Next, by analyzing the expression of host cell receptors using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of human lung tissues, comparative tropism analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, but not non-respiratory viruses, had remarkably overlapping and enriched cellular tropism in alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. This finding indicates the possibility of coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses, perhaps implying sociovirology at the cellular level. Moreover, the binding of viral entry proteins to the compatible host cell receptors is under strong natural selection pressure.

Rapid detection of the causative agent, severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is very important due to its high rate of infectivity. This study aimed to clarify the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 outside of Hubei province, China, and to optimize screening strategies for COVID-19 in attempts to contain spread of the virus. Methods This retrospective study included all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hunan Provincial People's Hospital (Changsha, China) between January 22 and February 15, 2020. All cases were detected using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The epidemiology and clinical characteristic of these cases were investigated according to outcome in attempts to optimize screening strategies for COVID-19. Results There were 24 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the fever outpatient department of Hunan Provincial People's Hospital. Three patients were asymptomatic, and 3 exhibited mild and 3 moderate disease. There was a family cluster phenomenon. Conclusion Individuals with COVID-19 can be asymptomatic or exhibit mild manifestations of disease.

References to territory, whether on packaging or in advertising, have become an increasingly popular way for marketers to differentiate products, by attributing specific characteristics to them, derived from specific cultural identities and traditions. The aim of this study is to capture the possible differences between two groups, Italian and French, in the perception and intention to buy products with certification marks. We tested a multi-group structural equations model, assessing the mediation of the Perceived Product Safety (PPS) between Packaging with reference to Territoriality (PT) and Intention to Buy (IB). Our findings show that in both groups PT has a positive association with IB and PPS and that PPS has a positive association with IB. The difference is the mediation of PPS, present only in the Italian group. This opens important considerations on the role of the perception of safety, particularly in the pandemic period, in the presentation of products, particularly in products with certification marks linked to sustainability and territoriality.",2021-10-02,"Russo, Vincenzo; Zito, Margherita; Bilucaglia, Marco; Circi, Riccardo; Bellati, Mara; Marin, Laura Emma Milani; Catania, Elisabetta; Licitra, Giuseppe",Foods,,document_parses/pdf_json/cf8d2218039d87b5d960e5360353c784d96a5349.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8535696/,,2021,183

Methods: The PubMed and Embase databases were searched for eligible studies published up to July 2020 (PROSPERO: CRD42018091692). The non-linear or linear exposure–effect relationship between PA and AF was examined using the robust error meta-regression method. Results: A total of 16 prospective studies involving 1,449,017 individuals and 39,884 AF cases were included. We observed an inverse non-linear association between PA level and incident AF (I(2) = 0%, p(non−linearity) < 0.001). In the linear model, a 5 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-h/week increase in PA was associated with a decreased risk of AF [risk ratio (RR) = 0.992, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.988–0.996, I(2) = 0%]. In the sex-stratified analysis, we observed an inverse non-linear relationship between PA level and AF risk in females (I(2) = 90%, p(non−linearity) < 0.0001) but not in males (I(2) = 0%, p(non−linearity) = 0.40). In the linear model, a 5 MET-h/week increase in PA was associated with a reduced risk of AF in females (RR = 0.982, 95% CI: 0.975–0.989, I(2) = 71%) but not in males (RR = 0.998, 95% CI: 0.994–1.002, I(2) = 0%), with a significant interaction observed between the two groups (p(interaction) < 0.0001).

Understanding infection dynamics has important implications for methods employed in hospitals to prevent nosocomial-transmission events. Methods In this case series report we describe a cluster of COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) in a tertiary care university hospital, in the early phases of the epidemic, after hospital visiting had been stopped and when the UK lockdown was in place. Findings A 48 year old patient developed COVID-19 31 days post-admission and four days after admission to a medical ward from ITU. Infection was likely acquired from an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic healthcare worker (HCW). Subsequent investigation over a 14 day period revealed symptoms in 23 staff members and five linked cases in patients on the same ward. Nine of the 23 affected staff members provided care for and had direct exposure with the index case. Four staff reported caring for the index case without use of personal protective equipment. One was coughed on directly by the patient 24 hours prior to the onset of symptoms. Conclusion SARS CoV2 infection can be introduced to a ward area by asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic healthcare workers. Staff members and patients can act as Trojan horses carrying infection into and around the hospital, setting up unexpected transmission events. Transmission of infection from pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic individuals means that universal use of measures to prevent transmission is required for successful reduction of transmission events in the hospital setting.",2020-07-04,"Asad, H.; Johnston, C.; Blyth, I.; Holborow, A.; Bone, A.; Porter, L.; Tidswell, P.; Healy, B.",Infection prevention in practice,,document_parses/pdf_json/722cb5a2b1aab20b77cd2e0001bddcaaacc12d5d.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34316562/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infpip.2020.100073; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590088920300378; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590088920300378,220323541.0,2020,249

STUDY DESIGN: This is an observational study via an anonymous electronic survey of seven questions focus on where survey recipients received information about the vaccine roll-out, their motivations for receiving the vaccine and their level of comfort in receiving the vaccine. SETTING: The Liverpool Vaccination Hub is located in South Western Sydney. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were healthcare workers who received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in the Australian Government’s Phase 1a and 1b priority categories. The majority of survey respondents (70%) were female (median aged between 35 and 44 years). The majority of survey respondents were clinical workers, such as nurse, paramedics and doctors. OUTCOME MEASURES: χ(2) analysis was used for analysis of survey responses in univariate analysis. Logistic regression was used to analyse survey responses, adjusting for week, type of health worker and age. RESULTS: 4746 healthcare workers responded to the survey after receiving their first vaccine dose, a response rate of 23%. Over 90% of respondents said that COVID-19 vaccination information from their organisation was easily available. Most of them reported that they were comfortable receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The majority of respondents were motivated to receive the vaccine due to concern about contracting COVID-19 themselves (75%), or concerns about transmitting it to other people such as patients (52%), family members (65%) or other community members (54%). Younger respondents were more likely to have preferred more information on vaccine safety (p<0.0001) and the effectiveness of the vaccine (p<0.0001).

Our aims were to determine if infants born moderately prematurely (32–35 weeks of gestation) who had had an RSV hospitalisation, compared to those who had not, had greater healthcare utilisation and related cost of care in the first 2 years. Two thousand and sixty-six eligible infants’ records were examined to identify three groups: 20 infants admitted for an RSV lower respiratory tract infection (RSV), 30 admitted for another respiratory problem (other respiratory) and 108 admitted for a non-respiratory problem/never admitted (non-respiratory). Healthcare utilisation was assessed by examining hospital and general practitioner records and cost of care calculated using the National Scheme of Reference costs and the British National Formulary prices. The mean cost of care in the RSV group (£12,505) was greater than the non-respiratory (£1,178) (95% CI for difference £5,015 to £17,639, p = 0.002) and the other respiratory (£3,356) groups (95% CI for difference £2,963 to £15,606, p < 0.001). The adjusted mean differences in the cost of care were £11,186 between the RSV and non-respiratory groups (95% CI £4,763 to £17,609) and £9,076 (95% CI £2,515 to £15,637) between the RSV and the other respiratory groups. Forty-two of 2,066 eligible infants had an RSV hospitalisation (2%); thus, assuming prophylaxis would reduce the hospitalisation rate by 50%, the number needed to treat was 98.

We evaluated the frequency of viral testing, virus prevalence, risk factors and treatment coverage with oseltamivir in patients admitted for CAP. METHODS: Secondary analysis of GLIMP, an international, multicenter, point-prevalence study of hospitalized adults with CAP. Testing frequency, prevalence of viral CAP and treatment with oseltamivir were assessed among patients who underwent a viral swab. Univariate and multivariate analysis was used to evaluate risk factors. RESULTS: 553 (14.9%) patients with CAP underwent nasal swab. Viral CAP was diagnosed in 157 (28.4%) patients.

Since the lockdown, screening examinations and routine checkups have been restricted to prevent the spread of the virus and to increase the hospitals’ bed capacity across the country. This resulted in a severe decline of patient referrals to the hospitals. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rate of newly diagnosed gynecological and breast cancers in Austria. METHODS: Data of 2077 patients from 18 centers in Austria with newly diagnosed gynecological or breast cancer between January and May 2019 and January and May 2020 were collected. Clinical parameters, including symptoms, performance status, co-morbidities, and referral status, were compared between the time before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: Our results showed a slight increase of newly diagnosed cancers in January and February 2020 as compared with 2019 (+2 and +35%, respectively) and a strong decline in newly diagnosed tumors since the lockdown: −24% in March 2020 versus March 2019, −49% in April 2020 versus April 2019, −49% in May 2020 versus May 2019. Two-thirds of patients diagnosed during the pandemic presented with tumor-specific symptoms compared with less than 50% before the pandemic (p<0.001). Moreover, almost 50% of patients in 2020 had no co-morbidities compared with 35% in 2019 (p<0.001). Patients, who already had a malignant disease, were rarely diagnosed with a new cancer in 2020 as compared with 2019 (11% vs 6%; p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The lockdown led to a decreased number of newly diagnosed gynecological and breast cancers.

To reduce the impact of the epidemic on humans, it is important to detect the symptoms of the disease in a timely and accurate manner. Recently, several new variants of COVID-19 have been identified in the United Kingdom (UK), South Africa, Brazil and India, and preliminary findings have been suggested that these mutations increase the transmissibility of the virus. Therefore, the aim of this study is to construct a support system based on fuzzy logic for experts to help detect of COVID-19 infection risk in a timely and accurate manner and to get a numerical output on symptoms of the virus from every person. The decision support system consists of three different sub and one main Mamdani type fuzzy inference systems (FIS). Subsystems are Common- Serious symptoms (First), Rare Symptoms (Second) and Personal Information (Third). The first FIS has five inputs, fever-time, cough-time, fatigue-time, shortness of breath and chest pain/dysfunction; the second FIS has four inputs, Loss of Taste/Smell, Body Aches, Conjuctivitis, and Nausea/Vomiting/Diarrhea; and the third FIS has three inputs, Age, Smoke, and Comorbidities. Then, we obtain personal risk index of individual by combining the outputs of these subsystems in a final FIS.

A good number of people are falling prey to anti-vaccination campaigns, and therefore, some amount of vaccine hesitancy must have developed. The primary objective of the study was to find the level of potential COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Kashmiri population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in the valley of Kashmir. A predesigned questionnaire was shared online. The participation of respondents was voluntary. Exclusions were made on account of residence outside Kashmir valley, duplicate forms, and wrong information. The data were entered into Microsoft Excel 2010 and analyzed using SPSS version 23. RESULTS: A total of 487 respondents were included. About 67% of the participants were in the age group of ≤30 years, 55% female, 54% rural, and 16% had ever been COVID-19 positive. About 14% of the participants were completely hesitant about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, whereas 40% were unsure if they will accept the vaccination. The main reason for the total nonacceptance of the vaccine was the doubts about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines (67%). Urban people were more likely to be hesitant to the vaccine than rural people (odds ratio [OR] 1.845, confidence interval CI 1.022 to 3.333). Those who were ever COVID-19 positive were 3.3 times more likely to say “no” to COVID-19 vaccination than those who were never positive.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this qualitative study was to explore oncology HPPs’ experiences with telehealth implementation during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study was conducted at Moffitt Cancer Center (Moffitt), an NCI (National Cancer Institute)-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Prior to COVID-19, Moffitt piloted telehealth visits on a limited basis. After COVID-19, Moffitt rapidly expanded telehealth visits. Telehealth visits included real-time videoconferencing between HPPs and patients and virtual check-ins (ie, brief communication with an HPP by telephone only). We conducted semistructured interviews with 40 oncology HPPs who implemented telehealth during COVID-19. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed for themes using Dedoose software (version 4.12). RESULTS: Approximately half of the 40 participants were physicians (n=22, 55%), and one-quarter of the participants were advanced practice providers (n=10, 25%). Other participants included social workers (n=3, 8%), psychologists (n=2, 5%), dieticians (n=2, 5%), and a pharmacist (n=1, 3%). Five key themes were identified: (1) establishing and maintaining patient-HPP relationships, (2) coordinating care with other HPPs and informal caregivers, (3) adapting in-person assessments for telehealth, (4) developing workflows and allocating resources, and (5) future recommendations. Participants described innovative strategies for implementing telehealth, such as coordinating interdisciplinary visits with multiple HPPs and inviting informal caregivers (eg, spouse) to participate in telehealth visits. Health care workers discussed key challenges, such as workflow integration, lack of physical exam and biometric data, and overcoming the digital divide (eg, telehealth accessibility among patients with communication-related disabilities). Participants recommended policy advocacy to support telehealth (eg, medical licensure policies) and monitoring how telehealth affects patient outcomes and health care delivery. CONCLUSIONS: To support telehealth growth, implementation strategies are needed to ensure that HPPs and patients have the tools necessary to effectively engage in telehealth. At the same time, cancer care organizations will need to engage in advocacy to ensure that policies are supportive of oncology telehealth and develop systems to monitor the impact of telehealth on patient outcomes, health care quality, costs, and equity.",2022-01-19,"Turner, Kea; Bobonis Babilonia, Margarita; Naso, Cristina; Nguyen, Oliver; Gonzalez, Brian D; Oswald, Laura B; Robinson, Edmondo; Elston Lafata, Jennifer; Ferguson, Robert J; Alishahi Tabriz, Amir; Patel, Krupal B; Hallanger-Johnson, Julie; Aldawoodi, Nasrin; Hong, Young-Rock; Jim, Heather S L; Spiess, Philippe E",J Med Internet Res,,,https://doi.org/10.2196/29635; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34907900/,245143541.0,2022,346

The apelin–APJ receptor pathway has been implicated in HF, making it a promising therapeutic target. APJ has been shown to be activated by a novel endogenous peptide ligand known as Elabela (ELA, also called Toddler or Apela), with a critical role in cardiac development and function. Activation of the ELA–APJ receptor axis exerts a wide range of physiological effects, including depressor response, positive inotropic action, diuresis, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrotic, and anti-remodeling, leading to its cardiovascular protection. The ELA–APJ axis is essential for diverse biological processes and has been shown to regulate fluid homeostasis, myocardial contractility, vasodilation, angiogenesis, cellular differentiation, apoptosis, oxidative stress, cardiorenal fibrosis, and dysfunction. The beneficial effects of the ELA–APJ receptor system are well-established by treating hypertension, myocardial infarction, and HF. Additionally, administration of ELA protects human embryonic stem cells against apoptosis and stress-induced cell death and promotes survival and self-renewal in an APJ-independent manner (X receptor) via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, which may provide a new therapeutic approach for HF. Thus, targeting the ELA–APJ axis has emerged as a pre-warning biomarker and a novel therapeutic approach against progression of HF. An increased understanding of cardiovascular actions of ELA will help to develop effective interventions.

We demonstrated that human enterovirus A71 (EVA71), a primary causative agent for hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), increased the level of the DNA damage response (DDR) marker γ-H2AX. DDR is primarily mediated by the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ATM and Rad3-related (ATR), or DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) pathways. Upregulation of γ-H2AX by EVA71 was dependent on the ATR but not the ATM or DNA-PK pathway. As a nuclear factor, there is no previous evidence of cytoplasmic distribution of γ-H2AX. However, the present findings demonstrated that EVA71 encouraged the localization of γ-H2AX to the cytoplasm. Of note, γ-H2AX formed a complex with structural protein VP3, non-structural protein 3D, and the viral genome. Treatment with an inhibitor or CRISPR/Cas9 technology to decrease or silence the expression of γ-H2AX decreased viral genome replication in host cells; this effect was accompanied by decreased viral protein expression and virions. In animal experiments, caffeine was used to inhibit DDR; the results revealed that caffeine protected neonatal mice from death after infection with EVA71, laying the foundation for new therapeutic applications of caffeine. More importantly, in children with HFMD, γ-H2AX was upregulated in peripheral blood lymphocytes. The consistent in vitro and in vivo data on γ-H2AX from this study suggested that caffeine or other inhibitors of DDR might be novel therapeutic agents for HFMD.",2022-01-22,"Yu, Jinghua; Zhang, Wenyan; Huo, Wenbo; Meng, Xiangling; Zhong, Ting; Su, Ying; Liu, Yumeng; Liu, Jinming; Wang, Zengyan; Song, Fengmei; Zhang, Shuxia; Li, Zhaolong; Yu, Xiaoyan; Yu, Xiaofang; Hua, Shucheng",Virulence,,document_parses/pdf_json/8ae6b76c34f522c5c6f33bb2ace964f0f75041a5.json,https://doi.org/10.1080/21505594.2022.2028482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35067196/,246238875.0,2022,226

Current treatments are limited in both availability and efficacy, such that improving our understanding of the factors that facilitate infection is urgently needed to more effectively treat infected individuals and to curb the pandemic. We and others have previously demonstrated the significance of interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, integrin α5β1, and human ACE2 to facilitate viral entry into host cells in vitro. We previously found that inhibition of integrin α5β1 by the clinically validated small peptide ATN-161 inhibits these spike protein interactions and cell infection in vitro. In continuation with our previous findings, here we have further evaluated the therapeutic potential of ATN-161 on SARS-CoV-2 infection in k18-hACE2 transgenic (SARS-CoV-2 susceptible) mice in vivo. We discovered that treatment with single or repeated intravenous doses of ATN-161 (1 mg/kg) within 48 h after intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 lead to a reduction of lung viral load, viral immunofluorescence, and improved lung histology in a majority of mice 72 h post-infection. Furthermore, ATN-161 reduced SARS-CoV-2-induced increased expression of lung integrin α5 and αv (an α5-related integrin that has also been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 interactions) as well as the C–X–C motif chemokine ligand 10 (Cxcl10), further supporting the potential involvement of these integrins, and the anti-inflammatory potential of ATN-161, respectively, in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The study of differentially expressed genes in case-control cohorts of patients is often the first step in understanding the details of the cell’s dysregulation. A further level of analysis is introduced by noticing that genes are organized in functional modules (often called pathways), thus their action and their dysregulation may be better understood by the identification of the modules most affected by the disease (aka disease modules, or active subnetworks). We describe how an algorithm based on the Core&Peel method developed originally for detecting protein complexes in PPI networks, can be adapted to detect disease modules in co-expression networks of genes. We first validate Core&Peel for the easier general task of functional module detection by comparison with 42 methods participating in the Disease Module Identification DREAM challenge of 2019. Next, we use four specific disease test cases (colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, asthma and rheumatoid arthritis), four state-of-the-art algorithms (ModuleDiscoverer, Degas, KeyPathwayMiner and ClustEx), and several pathway databases to validate the proposed algorithm. Core&Peel is the only method able to find significant associations of the predicted disease module with known validated relevant pathways for all four diseases. Moreover for the two cancer data sets, Core&Peel detects further nine relevant pathways enriched in the predicted disease module, not discovered by the other methods used in the comparative analysis. Finally we apply Core&Peel, along with other methods, to explore the transcriptional response of human cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, at a modular level, aiming at finding supporting evidence for drug repositioning efforts.",2020-05-27,"Lucchetta, M.; Pellegrini, M.",bioRxiv,,document_parses/pdf_json/3cf7706c1db431a42f87b1fb53c2c8c5f61b0af0.json,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.27.118414,219153918.0,2020,257

However, it also has disadvantages. For example, the rapidity of bacterial protein expression often results in unfolded/misfolded proteins, especially for heterologous proteins that require longer times and/or molecular chaperones to fold correctly. In addition, the highly reductive environment of the bacterial cytosol and the inability of E. coli to perform several eukaryotic post‐translational modifications results in the insoluble expression of proteins that require these modifications for folding and activity. Fortunately, multiple, novel reagents and techniques have been developed that allow for the efficient, soluble production of a diverse range of heterologous proteins in E. coli .

Conditions that alter thyroid hormones, which play a critical role in regulating metabolic pathways, have a role in the level of infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2. The capability of the SARS-CoV-2 to invade and affect any organ system is dependent on its access to the angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) commonly expressed among various host cells. This binding puts any system at high risk of direct viral injury, inevitably creating an excessively high concentration of anti-inflammatory mediators and cytokines to predispose COVID-19 patients to a state of severe immunosuppression. This case report describes a 62-year-old female who tested positive for COVID-19, with a medical history of hypothyroidism, who presented with a unique combination of acute bacterial hemorrhagic pyelonephritis and ureteral obstruction. She experienced intermittent dysuria, urinary urgency, and hematuria over the past five days. She developed chills, diaphoresis, nausea, and vomiting after administering acetaminophen for her headache. Ageusia and anosmia accompanied her respiratory illnesses despite receiving the Pfizer double dose vaccine six months before her arrival. A computerized tomography (CT) scan revealed severe to moderate inflammation surrounding the enlarged kidney with a 1 mm ureteral stone. Blood and urine cultures showed the growth of Escherichia coli gram-negative bacilli. Chest X-rays displayed a patchy appearance in the right infrahilar airspace, reflecting atelectasis in part for the diagnosis of COVID-19 with additional laboratory findings of profoundly elevated C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and d-dimer levels. Abdominal CT scans revealed a hemorrhagic ureteral obstruction and massive swelling of the renal parenchyma persistent to pyelonephritis and hydronephrosis.",2022-01-30,"Shazley, Omar; Shazley, Ameer; Alshazley, Moudar",Cureus,,document_parses/pdf_json/88186d3a9b525795749ed5e7b61688f88aca0af5.json,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.21730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35251803/,246438394.0,2022,374

It has resulted in tremendous uncertainty and diminished the recent advances to increase access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy—an objective preserved in the UN Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG-7). According to the IEA, attaining universal electricity access in Africa in line with SDG-7 entails annual investments of approximately $20 billion over the next decade. Given the sizeable magnitudes involved, it is inevitable that energy projects will need to rely on richer nations for energy aid. This paper explores the linkages between energy-related external aid, carbon emissions, per capita GDP, and electricity access for a sample of 30 low-income SSA countries over 1995 to 2016. Our econometric analysis reveals that while all types of energy aid facilitate economic growth in the long run, there is no direct impact of energy-related aid on electricity access. However, an increase in per capita GDP is positively associated with electricity access in both rural and urban areas. We also find that energy-related aid helps mitigate carbon emissions as well as contribute to GDP. Taken together, our results suggest that enhanced energy-related aid to low-income SSA countries can directly facilitate climate compatible growth and indirectly impel improvements in electricity access thereby helping with poverty reduction. We also advocate regional cooperation among SSA countries as a collective effort to confront shared energy challenges.",2022-01-28,"Li, Dmitriy; Bae, Jeong Hwan; Rishi, Meenakshi",Eur J Dev Res,,document_parses/pdf_json/7f2ba32e7f53f13f8e949087ee3020bd7fd1d266.json,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41287-021-00502-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35106034/,246386986.0,2022,227

The aim of this study is to describe the COVID-19 orthopedic trauma patients characteristics and management in a dedicated Orthopedic and Traumatology Hospital in Italy during the first pandemic period. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cohort of 25 consecutive patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection were retrospectively analyzed. Health system rearrangement, patients’ clinical presentation, diagnostic tools role, laboratory finding, treatment and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Health system rearrangement was fast. There was no clear prevalence of comorbidity or surgery type between confirmed and suspected COVID-19 cases. Nine positive swabs tests and 14 cases with only suspected CT scan findings were recorded. Several laboratory changes have been reported since the onset of symptoms: anemia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, coagulation abnormalities, alkaline phosphatase, liver enzymes and C-reactive protein alterations. Nineteen patients were treated by oxygen supplement, three patients were administered antivirals, eight antibiotic therapy, and nine hydroxychloroquine. The number of discharges reported in this study was greater than 52% and the number of deaths reached 20%. CONCLUSION: To our experience, the development of patient management algorithms allows the differentiation of the clinical pathways of negative and suspected/positive patients, reducing exposure, and virus spreading. The execution of swabs on all patients allows an early diagnosis and a more adequate management. Considering the different therapy patterns used, there were no significant differences, but anti-thromboembolic prophylaxis administered to all the orthopedic patients may have contributed to complications and mortality rates reduction.",2021-06-02,"Faldini, C.; Mazzotti, A.; Arceri, A.; Broccoli, E.; Barbagli, E.; Di Martino, A.",Musculoskelet Surg,,document_parses/pdf_json/78e9225dc7b46e703439d9f60f211366af748c1f.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12306-021-00715-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34075546/,235272035.0,2021,248

In order to identify gene(s) involved in this complex disorder, we performed a genome-wide search in a selected sample of 31 patients with primary VUR from eight families originating from southern Italy. Sixteen additional families with 41 patients were included in a second stage. Nonparametric, affected-only linkage analysis identified four genomic areas on chromosomes 1, 3, and 4 (p < 0.05); the best result corresponded to the D3S3681-D3S1569 interval on chromosome 3 (nonparametric linkage score, NPL = 2.75, p = 0.008).

Since angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) increase ACE2 receptor expression, it has been tacitly believed that the use of these agents may facilitate viral disease, thus they should not be used in high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease. Based on the anti-inflammatory benefits of the upregulation of the ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas axis and previously demonstrated benefits of lung function improvement in SARS-CoV infections, we hypothesize that the benefits of treatment with renin-angiotensin system inhibitors in SARS-COV2 may outweigh the risks and at the very least should not be withheld.",2020-04-16,"Brojakowska, Agnieszka; Narula, Jagat; Shimony, Rony; Bander, Jeffrey",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,,document_parses/pdf_json/da87d746da07b29ae9513e4a0b5ed4867f8cca35.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735109720350014; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.028; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109720350014?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32305401/,215787681.0,2020,132

The pathogenic potential of these human viruses has not been determined completely, but a correlation between immunosuppression and virus reactivation has been suggested. In the present study, the association between KI/WUPyV infection and immunosuppression was investigated using sequential nasopharyngeal aspirates from asymptomatic adult hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. In parallel, an investigation on the WU/KIPyV prevalence in children with acute respiratory disease was also carried out. Two of the 126 samples obtained from the 31 hematopoietic transplant recipients were positive for KIPyV (1 sample, 0.79%) and WUPyV (1 sample, 0.79%). Both samples were obtained 15 days after allogeneic transplantation and virus persistence was not observed in subsequent samples. In symptomatic children, 7 of the 486 nasopharyngeal aspirates were positive for WUPyV (1.4%) and 1 for KIPyV (0.2%). Single polyomavirus infection was detected in four patients, whereas the remaining patients were co‐infected with respiratory syncityal virus (three patients) or adenovirus (one patient). The results suggest that WU/KIPyVs have a limited circulation in Italy and a low pathogenic potential in young children.

The financial costs associated with data breaches are also growing. The costs associated with a data breach may divert resources away from patient care, thus negatively affecting hospital productivity. OBJECTIVE: After a data breach, the resulting regulatory enforcement and remediation are a shock to a hospital’s patient care delivery. Exploiting this shock, this study aimed to investigate the association between hospital data breaches and productivity by using a generalized difference-in-differences model with multiple prebreach and postbreach periods. METHODS: The study analyzed the hospital financial data of the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development from 2012 to 2016. The study sample was an unbalanced panel of hospitals with 2610 unique hospital-year observations, including general acute care hospitals. California hospital data were merged with breach data published by the US Department of Health and Human Services. The dependent variable was hospital productivity measured as value added. The difference-in-differences model was estimated using fixed effects regression. RESULTS: Hospital productivity did not significantly differ from the baseline for 3 years after a breach. Data breaches were not significantly associated with a reduction in hospital productivity. Before a breach, the productivity of hospitals that experienced a data breach maintained a parallel trend with control hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital productivity was resilient against the shocks from a data breach. Nonetheless, data breaches continue to threaten hospitals; therefore, health care workers should be trained in cybersecurity to mitigate disruptions.",2021-07-06,"Lee, Jinhyung; Choi, Sung J",J Med Internet Res,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8293158/,,2021,246

Due to the lack of specific and effective antiviral drugs, transmission of the disease increases exponentially and makes it more serious and harder to control. Drugs that were assumed to be effective against COVID-19 have failed in various stages of clinical trials and this made the scientific community more disappointed. But, the race of researchers for developing new and effective antiviral to stop the disease progression still continues and our work is one among them. This study is an attempt to analyze the action of Tectoquinone and Acteoside; an important phytocompound, on SARS-CoV2 viral protease via in silico approach. The compounds were selected on the basis of their molecular docking values and they were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations about 50 ns to determine the stability and the thermodynamic feasibility between the target and the ligands. Binding energies like hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions of the complexes were determined after MD simulations. The Pharmacokinetics and drug likeness evaluation of the compounds provide a strong evidence for the use of these compounds in developing drugs for clinical trials. Thus, the current study reveals the potential phytoconstituents present in Tectona grandis Linn to inhibit COVID-19 viral protease and thereby act as a lead therapeutic agent.

SETTING: Primary care data and pseudonymously linked hospital and intensive care admissions and death records from England, during wave 1 (1 February to 31 August 2020) and wave 2 (1 September to 18 December 2020).

The objective of this study was to analyze public interest in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) preventive measures and to identify variables associated with timely stay-at-home (SAH) orders issued by governors. METHODS: State-level search volume was collected from Google Trends. Average preventive measure interest was calculated for the query terms “hand sanitizer,” “hand washing,” “social distancing,” and “COVID testing.” We then calculated the delay in statewide SAH orders from March 1, 2020, to the date of issuance and by-state presidential voting percentage. Bivariate correlations were computed to assess the relationship between interest in preventive measures and SAH order delay. RESULTS: The correlation between average preventive measure interest and length of time before the SAH order was placed was −0.47. Average preventive measure interest was also inversely related to voting for a Republican presidential nominee in the 2016 election (R = −0.75), the latter of which was positively associated with longer delays in SAH orders (R = 0.48). CONCLUSIONS: States with greater public interest in COVID-19 preventive measures were inversely related to governor issuance of timely SAH orders.

However, applying and reporting propensity score techniques correctly requires substantial knowledge of these methods. The quality of conduct and reporting of propensity score methods in studies investigating the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy is yet undetermined. METHODS: A systematic review was performed to provide an overview of studies (2005–2020) on the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy that used propensity score methods. A quality assessment tool and a standardized quality score were developed to evaluate a subset of studies in which antibacterial therapy was investigated in detail. The scale of this standardized score ranges between 0 (lowest quality) and 100 (excellent). RESULTS: A total of 437 studies were included. The absolute number of studies that investigated the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy and that used propensity score methods increased 15-fold between the periods 2005–2009 and 2015–2019. Propensity score matching was the most frequently applied technique (65%), followed by propensity score–adjusted multivariable regression (25%). A subset of 108 studies was evaluated in detail. The median standardized quality score per year ranged between 53 and 61 (overall range: 33–88) and remained constant over the years. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of conduct and reporting of propensity score methods in research on the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy needs substantial improvement.

METHODS: From August 13, 2020, to May 31, 2021, 48 long-COVID patients with respiratory symptoms (27 men and 21 women; median age, 62.0 years; interquartile range: 54.0–69.0 years) underwent follow-up paired inspiration-expiration thin-section CT scans. Patient demographics, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission rate, and clinical and laboratory features of acute infection were also included. The scans were obtained on a median of 72.5 days after onset of symptoms (interquartile range: 58.5–86.5) and at least 30 days after hospital discharge. Thin-section CT findings included ground-glass opacity, mosaic attenuation pattern, consolidation, traction bronchiectasis, reticulation, parenchymal bands, bronchial wall thickening, and air trapping. We used a quantitative score to determine the degree of air trapping in the expiratory scans. RESULTS: Parenchymal abnormality was found in 50% (24/48) of patients and included air trapping (37/48, 77%), ground-glass opacities (19/48, 40%), reticulation (18/48, 38%), parenchymal bands (15/48, 31%), traction bronchiectasis (9/48, 19%), mosaic attenuation pattern (9/48, 19%), bronchial wall thickening (6/48, 13%), and consolidation (2/48, 4%).

In particular, we study how the COVID-19 epidemics evolves and how it is contained by different vaccination scenarios by taking into account data showing that older people, as well as individuals with comorbidities and poor metabolic health, and people coming from economically depressed areas with lower quality of life in general, are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms, and quicker loss of immunity and are therefore more prone to reinfection. Our results reveal that the structure and the spatial arrangement of subpopulations are important epidemiological determinants. In a healthier society the disease spreads more rapidly but the consequences are less disastrous as in a society with more prevalent chronic comorbidities. If individuals with poor health are segregated within one community, the epidemic outcome is less favorable. Moreover, we show that, contrary to currently widely adopted vaccination policies, prioritizing elderly and other higher-risk groups is beneficial only if the supply of vaccine is high. If, however, the vaccination availability is limited, and if the demographic distribution across the social network is homogeneous, better epidemic outcomes are achieved if healthy people are vaccinated first. Only when higher-risk groups are segregated, like in elderly homes, their prioritization will lead to lower COVID-19 related deaths. Accordingly, young and healthy individuals should view vaccine uptake as not only protecting them, but perhaps even more so protecting the more vulnerable socio-demographic groups.",2021-06-08,"Markovič, Rene; Šterk, Marko; Marhl, Marko; Perc, Matjaž; Gosak, Marko",Results Phys,,document_parses/pdf_json/f92fdce6e5687f0de38630c61ac805dfa782c10d.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34123716/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211379721005507; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinp.2021.104433; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211379721005507?v=s5,235372604.0,2021,250

DESIGN: A Finite Mixture Model (FMM) is used to uncover a mix of two latent groups of hospitals that differ in quality. In the FMM, a multinomial logistic equation relates hospital-level factors to the odds of being in either group. A multiple linear regression relates the characteristics of communities served by hospitals to the patients' expected ratings of their experiences at hospitals in each group. Thus, this association potentially varies with hospital quality. The analysis was conducted via Stata. SETTING: Hospital ratings are measured by Hospital Compare using the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey, a patient satisfaction survey required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for hospitals in the USA. PARTICIPANTS: 2,816 Medicare-certified acute care hospitals across all US states. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Differences in the marginal impacts of key community demographics on patient experiences between the two groups of hospitals. RESULTS: We provide evidence that low-rated hospitals have much more variability in patient experience ratings than high-rated ones. Moreover, the experiences at low-rated hospitals are more sensitive to county demographic factors, which means exogenous shocks, like coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), will likely affect these hospitals differently, as such shocks are known to disproportionately affect their communities. CONCLUSIONS: Our results imply that low-rated hospitals with more variability in their HCAHPS responses are more likely to face adverse patient experiences due to COVID-19 than high-rated hospitals.

Owing to the abnormal expression in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, the CaMKIV has been considered a potential drug target. In the present study, we checked the binding affinity of plant-derived natural compounds viz., quercetin, ellagic acid (EA), simvastatin, capsaicin, ursolic acid, DL-α-tocopherol acetate, and limonin towards CaMKIV. Molecular docking and fluorescence binding studies showed that EA and quercetin bind to the CaMKIV with a considerable affinity in comparison to other compounds. Enzyme inhibition assay revealed that both EA and quercetin inhibit CaMKIV activity with their IC(50) values in the micromolar range. To get atomistic insights into the mode of interactions, inhibition mechanism, and the stability of the CaMKIV-ligand complex, a 100 ns MD simulation analysis was performed. Both EA and quercetin bind to the catalytically important residues of active site pocket of CaMKIV forming enough stabilizing interactions presumably inhibiting enzyme activity. Moreover, no significant structural change in the CaMKIV was observed upon binding of EA and quercetin. In conclusion, this study illustrates the application of phytoconstituents in the development of therapeutic molecules targeting CaMKIV having implications in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases after in vivo validation.",2020-07-16,"Gupta, Preeti; Khan, Shama; Fakhar, Zeynab; Hussain, Afzal; Rehman, Md.

We aimed to assess the association between wealth-related inequalities in coverage of RMNCH interventions. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we identified publicly available Demographic Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys from LMICs containing information on household characteristics, reproductive health, women's and children's health, nutrition, and mortality. We identified the most recent survey from the period 2010–19 for 36 countries that contained data for our preselected set of 18 RMNCH interventions. 21 countries also had information on two common malaria interventions. We classified interventions into four groups according to their predominant delivery channels: health facility based, community based, environmental, and culturally driven (including breastfeeding practices). Within each country, we derived wealth quintiles from information on household asset indices. We studied two summary measures of within-country wealth-related inequality: absolute inequalities (akin to coverage differences among children from wealthy and poor households) using the slope index of inequality (SII), and relative inequalities (akin to the ratio of coverage levels for wealthy and poor children) using the concentration index (CIX). Pro-poor inequalities are present when intervention coverage decreased with increasing household wealth, and pro-rich inequalities are present when intervention coverage increased as household wealth increased. FINDINGS: Across the 36 LMICs included in our analyses, coverage of most interventions had pro-rich patterns in most countries, except for two breastfeeding indicators that mostly had higher coverage among poor women, children and households than wealthy women, children, and households. Environmental interventions were the most unequal, particularly use of clean fuels, which had median levels of SII of 48·8 (8·6–85·7) and CIX of 67·0 (45·0–85·8). Interventions primarily delivered in health facilities—namely institutional childbirth (median SII 46·7 [23·1–63·3] and CIX 11·4 [4·5–23·4]) and antenatal care (median SII 26·7 [17·0–47·2] and CIX 10·0 [4·2–17·1])—also usually had pro-rich patterns. By comparison, primarily community-based interventions, including those against malaria, were more equitably distributed—eg, oral rehydration therapy (median SII 9·4 [2·9–19·0] and CIX 3·4 [1·3–25·0]) and polio immunisation (SII 12·1 [2·3–25·0] and CIX 3·1 [0·5–7·1]). Differences across the four types of delivery channels in terms of both inequality indices were significant (SII p=0·0052; CIX p=0·0048). INTERPRETATION: Interventions that are often delivered at community level are usually more equitably distributed than those primarily delivered in fixed facilities or those that require changes in the home environment. Policy makers need to learn from community delivery channels to promote more equitable access to all RMNCH interventions. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust.

All children had SIRS: ESR acceleration (15-43 mm/h), CRP increase in 6 cases (not more 5 norms), elevated ferritin (307-648 mkg/l) and D-dimer (3,24-8 mkg/ml). Mixed urinary syndrome was noted: proteinuria (0,1 - 6 g/l), hematuria (RBC 6-50). 100% had azotemia: urea (12,7-65,3, Me 35 mmol/l), creatinine (74-1450,2, Me 499 mkmol/l). GFR by Schwartz formula was reduced in all cases (1,7-58,1 ml/min/1,73 m2). 3 had anuria, 2 oliguria. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) performed in 5 cases: 3 hemodiafiltration (HDF) only; 2 - HDF + plasma exchange (1 - 7 procedures). All children were complex treated and discharged with normal clinical urine test and creatinine level, diuresis 1,6-2,4 ml/kg/h. Conclusion In MIS-C pathogenesis thrombotic microangiopathia is one of the key points. We saw elevation of HUS in children in the COVID-19-pandemia period. 6 from 8 described cases had connection of AKI with previous COVID-19. In addition, they all had SIRS markers, corresponding diagnostic criteria of SARS-Cov2 associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome.",2022-03-31,"Novikov, D.; Sabinina, T.; Melekhina, E.; Shalbarova, T.; Muzyka, A.; Ponezheva, Z.; Chugunova, O.; Pshenichnaya, N.",International Journal of Infectious Diseases,,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221010031; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.12.111; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221010031,247159485.0,2022,302

In addition to mutations in structural Spike glycoprotein, rapid accumulation of mutations across non-structural genes is leading to continuous virus evolution, altering its pathogenicity. We performed whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples collected from different clinical groups from eastern India, during the second pandemic wave (April-May, 2021). In addition to the several common spike mutations in Delta variant, two mutually explicit signature constellations of non-spike co-appearing mutations were identified, driving symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. We attempted to correlate these unique signatures of non-Spike co-appearing mutations to COVID-19 disease outcome. Results revealed that the Delta strains harboring a unique constellation of 9 non-spike co-appearing mutations could be the wheeler and dealer of symptomatic infection, even post vaccination. The strains predominantly driving asymptomatic infection possessed 7 non-spike co-appearing mutations, which were mutually exclusive in contrast to the set of mutations causing symptomatic disease. Phylodynamic analysis depicted high probability of emergence of these unique sub-clusters within India, with subsequent spread worldwide. Interestingly, some mutations of this signature were selected in Omicron and IHU variants, which suggest that gradual accumulation of such co-existing mutations may lead to emergence of more “vaccine-evading variants” in future. Hence, unfaltering genome sequencing and tracking of non-Spike mutations might be significant in formulation of any future vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that might evade the current vaccine-induced immunity.",2022-04-05,"Banerjee, Anindita; Mazumder, Anup; Roy, Jayita; Majumdar, Agniva; Chatterjee, Ananya; Biswas, Nidhan K; Sarkar, Mamta Chawla; Maitra, Arindam; Dutta, Shanta; Das, Saumitra",bioRxiv,,document_parses/pdf_json/593d00f5e1527accb89c4a2de81960d121d2e7e8.json,https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.05.487103,248027153.0,2022,250

Nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) is known to affect human health, causing heart and cardiovascular diseases, and it has been shown that locations with long term NO(2) pollution recorded a high number of fatalities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are no ground stations monitoring emissions of NO(2) over West Africa. The present study aimed to use satellite observations to examine pollutant trends over this region. OBJECTIVE. To examine the trend of NO(2) over the entire West Africa sub region in relationship to contributions to environmental emissions using satellite-derived data. This enables the assessment of West Africa regional air pollution hot spots in relationship to enhancing atmospheric factors. The results from this study will also be useful guidance for setting air quality standards for air pollution controls to minimize health hazards. METHODS. The present study examined thirteen years of average monthly values of nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) to determine the spatio-temporal variation of this pollutant over West Africa. Satellite data for NO(2) between 2005 and 2017 were used to determine the variation in pollution levels over West Africa. Correlations between NO(2) and meteorological variables (wind speed, rainfall and air temperature) were obtained to explain the influence of West African weather on the region's pollution accumulation. RESULTS. The present study observed that NO(2) concentrations varied from place to place and from season to season. Nitrogen dioxide concentrations during the dry season were higher (sometimes 200% higher) than values observed in the wet season which ranged between 0.5 and 6×10(15) molec/cm(2). Nitrogen dioxide north-south oscillation during the course of a year is largely controlled by the inter-tropical discontinuity (ITD) zone as high concentrations of NO(2) are found in the vicinity of the ITD where wind speeds and horizontal vorticity approaches zero. Correlation analysis between NO(2) and some atmospheric variables indicated NO(2) concentrations are well influenced by atmospheric variables showing bipolar signals depending on the season. An increasing trend of NO(2) was also found over selected cities of the region. This indicated that regional air quality is gradually deteriorating. CONCLUSIONS. The implications of worsening regional air quality were examined in the light of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. The dominant atmospheric factor determining pollution episodes in the region is the inter-tropical discontinuity line which marks the meeting point between the two wind regimes over the region. Densely populated areas are characteristically prone to elevated pollution and have experienced high fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic. COMPETING INTERESTS.

Previously, we demonstrated that MERS-CoV-encoded ORF8b strongly inhibits MDA5- and RIG-I-mediated induction of the interferon beta (IFN-β) promoter activities. Here, we report that ORF8b seem to regulate MDA5 or RIG-I differentially as protein levels of MDA5 were significantly down-regulated while those of RIG-I were largely unperturbed. In addition, ORF8b seemed to efficiently suppress phosphorylation of IRF3 at the residues of 386 and 396 in cells transfected with RIG-I while total endogenous levels of IRF3 remained largely unchanged. Furthermore, ORF8b was able to inhibit all forms of RIG-I; full-length, RIG-I-1-734, and RIG-I-1-228, last of which contains only the CARD domains. Taken together, it is tempting to postulate that ORF8b may interfere with the CARD-CARD interactions between RIG-I and MAVS.

Institutional social distancing requirements have resulted in many neurosurgical programs utilizing video conferencing for educational activities. However, it is unclear how or if these practices should continue after the pandemic. The objective of this study was to characterize virtual education in neurosurgery and understand how it should be utilized after COVID-19. METHODS A 24-question, 3-part online survey was administered anonymously to all 117 US neurosurgical residency programs from May 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020. Questions pertained to the current use of virtual conferencing, preferences over traditional conferences, and future inclinations. The Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 3 = neutral, 5 = strongly agree) was used. Comparisons were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. RESULTS One-hundred eight responses were recorded. Overall, 38 respondents (35.2%) were attendings and 70 (64.8%) were trainees. Forty-one respondents (38.0%) indicated attending 5-6 conferences per week and 70 (64.8%) attend national virtual conferences. When considering different conference types, there was no overall preference (scores < 3) for virtual conferences over traditional conferences. In regard to future use, respondents strongly agreed that they would continue the practice at some capacity after the pandemic (median score 5). Overall, respondents agreed that virtual conferences would partially replace traditional conferences (median score 4), whereas they strongly disagreed with the complete replacement of traditional conferences (median score 1). The most common choices for the partial replacement of tradition conferences were case conferences (59/108, 55%) and board preparation (64/108, 59%). Lastly, there was a significant difference in scores for continued use of virtual conferencing in those who attend nationally sponsored conferences (median score 5, n = 70) and those who do not (median score 4, n = 38; U = 1762.50, z = 2.97, r = 0.29, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS Virtual conferences will likely remain an integral part of neurosurgical education after the COVID-19 pandemic has abated. Across the country, residents and faculty report a preference for continued use of virtual conferencing, especially virtual case conferences and board preparation. Some traditional conferences may even be replaced with virtual conferences, in particular those that are more didactic. Furthermore, nationally sponsored virtual conferences have a positive effect on the preferences for continued use of virtual conferences.",2020-12-01,"Lazaro, Tyler; Srinivasan, Visish M; Rahman, Maryam; Asthagiri, Ashok; Barkhoudarian, Garni; Chambless, Lola B; Kan, Peter; Rao, Ganesh; Nahed, Brian V; Patel, Akash J",Neurosurgical focus,,,https://doi.org/10.3171/2020.9.focus20672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260121/,227252801.0,2020,387

This study describes baseline emotional, cognitive and behavioural characteristics in participants in the HARPdoc trial, which evaluates a novel intervention for treatment-resistant problematic hypoglycaemia. METHODS: We documented a cross-sectional baseline description of 99 adults with type 1 diabetes and problematic hypoglycaemia despite structured education in flexible insulin therapy. The following measures were included: Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey II (HFS-II); Attitudes to Awareness of Hypoglycaemia questionnaire (A2A); Hospital Anxiety and Depression Index; and Problem Areas In Diabetes. k-mean cluster analysis was applied to HFS-II and A2A factors. Data were compared with a peer group without problematic hypoglycaemia, propensity-matched for age, sex and diabetes duration (n = 81). RESULTS: The HARPdoc cohort had long-duration diabetes (mean ± SD 35.8 ± 15.4 years), mean ± SD Gold score 5.3 ± 1.2 and a median (IQR) of 5.0 (2.0–12.0) severe hypoglycaemia episodes in the previous year. Most individuals had been offered technology and 49.5% screened positive for anxiety (35.0% for depression and 31.3% for high diabetes distress). The cohort segregated into two clusters: in one (n = 68), people endorsed A2A cognitive barriers to hypoglycaemia avoidance, with low fear on HFS-II factors; in the other (n = 29), A2A factor scores were low and HFS-II high. Anxiety and depression scores were significantly lower in the comparator group. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The HARPdoc protocol successfully recruited people with treatment-resistant problematic hypoglycaemia. The participants had high anxiety and depression. Most of the cohort endorsed unhelpful health beliefs around hypoglycaemia, with low fear of hypoglycaemia, a combination that may contribute to persistence of problematic hypoglycaemia and may be a target for adjunctive psychological therapies.

RESULTS: We identified five focal themes across the webpages published by the hospitals during our study period including (1) popular medical science education, (2) digitalized hospital processes, (3) knowledge management for medical professionals, (4) telemedicine, and (5) new IT initiatives for healthcare services. Our analysis revealed that Chinese hospitals spent greater effort in promoting popular medical science education in the initial stages of our study period and more on telemedicine in the latter stages.

This study involved a stroke patient with severe sensorimotor deficits and a retrospective AB design. Walk training was conducted only in phase A. Phase B consisted of anodal tDCS (1.5 mA) combined with walk training. Walking speed, stride time variability (STV; reflecting gait stability), and beta-band intramuscular coherence—derived from the paired tibialis anterior on the paretic side (reflecting CST excitability)—were measured. STV quantified the coefficient of variation in stride time using accelerometers. Intramuscular coherence during the early stance phase noticeably increased in phase B compared with phase A. Intramuscular coherence in both the stance and swing phases was reduced at follow-up. Walking speed showed no change, while STV was noticeably decreased in phase B compared with phase A.

Clinically, it is manifested by spontaneous bleeding mainly in the skin and soft tissues, and unlike hereditary hemophilia, the presence of hemarthrosis is infrequent. Although many cases are idiopathic, secondary causes must be sought since their treatment is key in the prognosis of the disease. Among these, the presence of autoimmune diseases, neoplasms, drugs, pregnancy, and postpartum stand out. Treatment is based on hemostatic measures to control the bleeding, and therapies to erradicate the autoantibody. METHODOLOGY: In the following manuscript we describe four patients with acquired hemophilia its etiology, treatment, and prognosis.

These deep models act as an aid to hospitals that suffer from the unavailability of specialists or radiologists, specifically in remote areas. Various deep models have been proposed to detect the COVID-19 cases, but few works have been performed to prevent the deep models against adversarial attacks capable of fooling the deep model by using a small perturbation in image pixels. This paper presents an evaluation of the performance of deep COVID-19 models against adversarial attacks. Also, it proposes an efficient yet effective Fuzzy Unique Image Transformation (FUIT) technique that downsamples the image pixels into an interval. The images obtained after the FUIT transformation are further utilized for training the secure deep model that preserves high accuracy of the diagnosis of COVID-19 cases and provides reliable defense against the adversarial attacks. The experiments and results show the proposed model prevents the deep model against the six adversarial attacks and maintains high accuracy to classify the COVID-19 cases from the Chest X-Ray image and CT image Datasets. The results also recommend that a careful inspection is required before practically applying the deep models to diagnose the COVID-19 cases.",2020-09-08,"Tripathi, Achyut Mani; Mishra, Ashish",,,document_parses/pdf_json/c0def5d83f234940d649af27ddd8648a0529ec5e.json,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.04004v1.pdf,221557171.0,2020,219

This zoonotic pandemic is proving to be the most destructive disease outbreaks since decades. The increasing human population and anthropogenic activities have impacted the environment and have direct linkages with the current and other recent outbreaks of zoonotic diseases. Despite having a difference in their origin, major reasons behind the emergence and spread of zoonotic pandemics are related to activities such as habitat fragmentation, deforestation, biodiversity loss, intensive agriculture and livestock farming, uncontrolled urbanization, pollution, climate change and bushmeat hunting and trading. It is important to focus on environmental and climatic factors that are involved in the emergence of such pandemics involving novel human pathogens and viruses in particular. Research and data analysis, particularly in relation to COVID-19, has shown that meteorological factors along with population density and living conditions (particularly in the urban and semi-urban areas) play a crucial role in the intensity, evolution and spread of SARS-CoV-2. This particular virus is novel but coronaviruses have a long history and are known to cause disease outbreaks earlier as well. COVID-19 pandemic provides learning for the future, in particular the importance of environmental sustainability for controlling such outbreaks. A strategic plan can be developed involving policy-makers, organizations, and governments to control the onset and spread of the novel pathogens. This review-based study recommends that prevention of COVID-19 like pandemics from re-occurring is through tackling the issues related to the environment by controlling anthropogenic activities.

In humans IFNL4 open reading frame is truncated by a polymorphic frame-shift insertion that eliminates IFN-λ4 and turns IFNL4 into a polymorphic pseudogene. Functional IFN-λ4 has antiviral activity but the elimination of IFN-λ4 through pseudogenization is strongly associated with improved clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We show that functional IFN-λ4 is conserved and evolutionarily constrained in mammals and thus functionally relevant. However, the pseudogene has reached moderately high frequency in Africa, America, and Europe, and near fixation in East Asia. In fact, the pseudogenizing variant is among the 0.8% most differentiated SNPs between Africa and East Asia genome-wide. Its raise in frequency is associated with additional evidence of positive selection, which is strongest in East Asia, where this variant falls in the 0.5% tail of SNPs with strongest signatures of recent positive selection genome-wide. Using a new Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach we infer that the pseudogenizing allele appeared just before the out-of-Africa migration and was immediately targeted by moderate positive selection; selection subsequently strengthened in European and Asian populations resulting in the high frequency observed today.

DESIGN Nationwide case-control study. SETTING Denmark. PARTICIPANTS All Danish children born from 1997 to 2014 and followed for asthma onset and persistent wheezing from age 1 year to 15 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Onset of asthma and persistent wheezing. RESULTS A higher incidence of asthma was found in children of parents with asthma (adjusted hazard ratio 2.29 (95% confidence interval 2.22 to 2.35) and mothers who smoked during pregnancy (1.20, 1.18 to 1.22), whereas a lower incidence was found in children of parents with high educational attainment (0.72, 0.69 to 0.75) and high incomes (0.85, 0.81 to 0.89). Exposure to particulate matter ≤2.5 µm (PM2.5) and ≤10 µm (PM10) and nitrate was associated with an increased risk of asthma and persistent wheezing, with hazard ratios per 5 µg/m3 increase in pollutant concentrations 1.05 (1.03 to 1.07) for PM2.5, 1.04 (1.02 to 1.06) for PM10, and 1.04 (1.03 to 1.04) for nitrogen dioxide.

The development of antiviral drugs directed against SARS-CoV-2 and effective vaccines is progressing; meanwhile, the best pharmacological objective is related to the management of all the complications caused by this viral infection, mainly controlling the inflammatory and fibrotic state and preventing the infection from moving into the most serious phases. SUBJECT AND METHOD: Describe the scientific rationale related to the use of an antifibrotic therapy with pirfenidone, as monotherapy and/or in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs to manage and control complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Based on the scientific literature and epidemiological results and considering the pathophysiological, biological, and molecular characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, an antifibrotic drug such as pirfenidone as monotherapy or in combination with anti-inflammatory drugs can be (acting early, at the right doses and at the right time) therapeutically effective to avoid serious complications during viral infection. The same approach can also be effective as postinfection therapy in patients with residual pulmonary fibrotic damage. Management of inflammation and fibrotic status with a combination therapy of pirfenidone and IL-6 or IL-1 inhibitors could represent a pharmacological synergy with added value.

Targeting the RdRp active sites, ASP760 and ASP761, by antiviral drugs could be a potential therapeutic option for inhibition of coronavirus RdRp, and thus viral replication. Target-based virtual screening and molecular docking results show that the antiviral Galidesivir and its structurally similar compounds have shown promise against SARS-CoV-2.

We extend prior perspectives on the customer journey by introducing the role of digital signals that consumers emit throughout their activities. We argue that the ability to detect and act on consumer digital signals is a source of competitive advantage for firms. Technology enables firms to collect, interpret, and act on these signals to better manage the customer journey. While some consumers’ desire for privacy can restrict the opportunities technology provides marketers, other consumers’ desire for personalization can encourage the use of technology to inform marketing efforts. We posit that this difference in consumers’ willingness to emit observable signals may hinge on the strength of their relationship with the firm. We next discuss factors that may shift consumer preferences and consequently affect the technology-enabled opportunities available to firms.

It inhibited the growth and proliferation of the parasites significantly with a IC50 value of 1.019 ± 0.116 mM in vitro. It also reduced the growth of intra-macrophagic amastigotes with a IC50 value of 0.2858 ± 0.01398 mM. It induced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in parasites in a dose-dependent manner. Through 2,7-dichloro dihydro fluorescein diacetate (H(2)DCFDA) staining, it was observed that around 96.9% parasites were ROS positive at 2.0 mM concentration of hesperidin. The ROS generated led to the apoptosis of parasites in a dose-dependent manner as observed by annexin/PI staining. Molecular docking with one of the very important and unique drug-targets of Leishmania donovani sterol C-24 reductase resulted in its significant inhibition.

So far, data on cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays is limited. Here, we compared four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs; Vircell SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA and IgG, Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG) for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 207 patients with COVID-19, 178 patients with serological evidence of different bacterial infections, 107 patients with confirmed viral respiratory disease, and 80 controls from the pre-COVID-19 era. In COVID-19 patients, the assays showed highest sensitivity in week 3 (Vircell-IgM/A and Euroimmun-IgA: 78.9% each) and after week 7 (Vircell-IgG: 97.9%; Euroimmun-IgG: 92.1%). The antibody indices were higher in patients with fatal disease. In general, IgM/IgA assays had only limited or no benefit over IgG assays. In patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections, IgG assays were more specific than IgM/IgA assays, and bacterial infections were associated with more false-positive results than viral infections. The specificities in bacterial and viral infections were 68.0 and 81.3% (Vircell-IgM/IgA), 84.8 and 96.3% (Euroimmun-IgA), 97.8 and 86.0% (Vircell-IgG), and 97.8 and 99.1% (Euroimmun-IgG), respectively. Sera from patients positive for antibodies against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia psittaci, and Legionella pneumophila yielded particularly high rates of unspecific false-positive results in the IgM/IgA assays, which was revealed by applying a highly specific flow-cytometric assay using HEK 293 T cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Positive results obtained with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgA ELISAs require careful interpretation, especially if there is evidence for prior bacterial respiratory infections.

Rapid development of molecular diagnostic tests and subunit vaccines have been prioritized, and as such evaluating the SARS-CoV-2 genomic plasticity and evolutionary dynamics is an urgent need. We determined the SARS-CoV-2 selectome by calculating rates of pervasive and episodic diversifying selection for every amino acid coding position in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. To provide context for evolutionary dynamics of a highly pathogenic betacoronavirus following a zoonotic spillover into human hosts, we also determined the selectomes of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and performed evolvability calculations for SARS-CoV-2 based on SARS-CoV. These analyses identify the amino acid sites within each coding sequence that have been subjected to pervasive diversifying selection or episodic diversifying selection, and report significantly evolvable sites in the ORF1a polyprotein, the spike protein, and the membrane protein of SARS-CoV-2.

In the current time of COVID-19 social distancing, technology can also help organizations more safely provide services to people with compromised immune systems and to clients who might otherwise not be reached. However, technology projects implemented in harm reduction settings are frequently conceptualized and developed by researchers or technology specialists rather than by SSP staff or clients. METHODS: To more effectively meet the needs of SSPs and other CBOs across the USA, our team conducted qualitative interviews with 16 individuals who have extensive backgrounds working in the field of harm reduction. Interviews were digitally recorded and professionally transcribed, and the transcripts were checked for accuracy by the interviewers. The resulting transcripts were coded and analyzed to determine emerging themes. RESULTS: Interviewees mentioned the ability of technology to deliver consistent quality messaging to multiple clients at the same time and the potential to customize or tailor technology-based messaging to specific client populations as positive benefits. Clear barriers to technology use also emerged, in particular regarding privacy, data security, and the need to maintain client trust when discussing sensitive issues (e.g., illicit drug use).

Our goal is to identify such spurious regions and use them to guide the abstraction refinement. The core idea is to make use of the obtained constraints of the abstraction to infer new bounds for the neurons. This is achieved by linear programming techniques. With the new bounds, we iteratively apply DeepPoly, aiming to eliminate spurious regions. We have implemented our approach in a prototypical tool DeepSRGR.

Data on how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced mortality, seasonality of, and susceptibility to AECOPD in the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) population is scarce. METHODS: We conducted a national population-based retrospective study using data from the Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia from 2015 to February 2021, with 2015–2019 as the reference. We extracted patient and healthcare data for AECOPD, dividing AECOPD into severe, resulting in hospitalisation, and moderate, requiring outpatient care. The national COPD population was generated based on dispensed prescriptions of inhalation therapies, and moderate AECOPD events were analysed based on dispensed AECOPD medications. We extracted data on all-cause and non-COVID mortality. RESULTS: The numbers of severe and moderate AECOPD were reduced by 48% and 34%, respectively, in 2020. In the pandemic year, the seasonality of AECOPD was reversed, with a 1.5-fold higher number of severe AECOPD in summer compared to winter. The proportion of frequent exacerbators (⩾2 AECOPD hospitalisations per year) was reduced by 9% in 2020, with a 30% reduction in repeated severe AECOPD in frequent exacerbators and a 34% reduction in persistent frequent exacerbators (⩾2 AECOPD hospitalisations per year for 2 consecutive years) from 2019. The risk of two or more moderate AECOPD decreased by 43% in 2020. In the multivariate model, pandemic year follow-up was the only independent factor associated with a decreased risk for severe AECOPD (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61–0.84; p < 0.0001). In 2020, non-COVID mortality decreased (−15%) and no excessive mortality was observed in the COPD population. CONCLUSION: In the pandemic year, we found decreased susceptibility to AECOPD across severity spectrum of COPD, reversed seasonal distribution of severe AECOPD and decreased non-COVID mortality in the COPD population.",2022-03-07,"Sarc, Irena; Lotric Dolinar, Alesa; Morgan, Tina; Sambt, Joze; Ziherl, Kristina; Gavric, Dalibor; Selb, Julij; Rozman, Ales; Dosenovic Bonca, Petra",Ther Adv Respir Dis,,document_parses/pdf_json/005fae9485a684b4d5453cb9d8236f3e256c293f.json,https://doi.org/10.1177/17534666221081047; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35253548/,247252762.0,2022,308

While virtual reality has been extensively studied across a wide range of clinical settings, no studies have yet evaluated potential impact on pain management on this patient population. AIM To investigate the impact of a virtual reality experience on self-reported pain, quality-of-life, general distress, and satisfaction compared to a two-dimensional guided imagery active control. DESIGN Single-center prospective randomized controlled study. The primary outcome was the difference in pre- versus post-intervention self-reported pain scores on a numerical rating scale from 0 to 10. Secondary outcomes included changes in quality-of-life scores, general distress, and satisfaction with the intervention. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS Between October 2018 and March 2020, 88 participants hospitalized with advanced heart failure were recruited from an urban tertiary academic medical center. RESULTS Participants experienced significant improvement in pain score after either 10 minutes of virtual reality (change from pre- to post -2.9 ± 2.6, p < 0.0001) or 10 minutes of guided imagery (change from pre- to post -1.3 ± 1.8, p = 0.0001); the virtual reality arm experienced a 1.5 unit comparatively greater reduction in pain score compared to guided imagery (p = 0.0011). Total quality-of-life and general distress scores did not significantly change for either arm. Seventy-eight participants (89%) responded that they would be willing to use the assigned intervention again.

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with coronary heart disease. Method: Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to collect the literature concerning coronary heart disease and COVID-19. The retrieval time was from inception to 20, 2020, using Stata version 14.0 for meta-analysis. Results: A total of 22,148 patients from 40 studies were included. The meta-analysis revealed that coronary heart disease was associated with poor prognosis of COVID-19 (OR=3.42, 95%CI [2.83, 4.13], P < 0.001). After subgroup analysis, coronary heart disease was found to be related to mortality (OR=3.75, 95%CI [2.91, 4.82], P < 0.001), severe/critical COVID-19 (OR=3.23, 95%CI [2.19, 4.77], P < 0.001), ICU admission (OR=2.25, 95%CI [1.34, 3.79], P = 0.002), disease progression (OR=3.01, 95%CI [1.46, 6.22], P = 0.003); Meta-regression showed that the association between coronary heart disease and poor prognosis of COVID-19 was affected by hypertension (P=0.004), and subgroup analysis showed that compared with the proportion of hypertension > 30% (OR=2.85, 95%CI [2.33, 3.49]), the proportion of hypertension < 30% (OR=4.78, 95%CI [3.50, 6.51]) had a higher risk of poor prognosis.

AIM: This retrospective cohort study aimed to assess if there were any changes in the number of patients hospitalized for respiratory diseases in Greece during the first CO­VID-19 wave. METHODS: In the present study, we evaluated respiratory disease hospitalization rates across 9 tertiary hospitals in Greece during the study period (March–April 2020) and the corresponding period of the 2 previous years (2018–2019) that served as the control periods. Demographic data and discharge diagnosis were documented for every patient. RESULTS: Of the 1,307 patients who were hospitalized during the study period, 444 (35.5%) were males with a mean (±SD) age of 66.1 ± 16.6 years. There was a 47 and 46% reduction in all-cause respiratory morbidity compared to the corresponding periods of 2018 and 2019, respectively. The mean incidence rate for respiratory diseases during the study period was 21.4 admissions per day, and this rate was significantly lower than the rate during the same period in 2018 (40.8 admissions per day; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.525; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.491–0.562; p < 0.001) or the rate during 2019 (39.9 admissions per day; IRR, 0.537; 95% CI, 0.502–0.574; p < 0.001). The greatest reductions (%) in the number of daily admissions in 2020 were observed for sleep apnoea (87% vs. 2018 and 84% vs. 2019) followed by admissions for asthma (76% vs. 2018 and 79% vs. 2019) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (60% vs. 2018 and 51% vs. 2019), while the lowest reductions were detected in hospitalizations for pulmonary embolism (6% vs. 2018 and 23% vs. 2019) followed by tuberculosis (25% vs. both 2018 and 2019).

METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was conducted among 18 to 49-year-old Chinese parents who had at least one child in June 2021. We calculated the prevalence of self-reported childrearing barriers and used univariate logistic regression and multivariate logistic regression to analyze associated factors. RESULTS: 94.7% of the respondents self-reported barriers to rearing children aged 0–3 years, and the biggest barrier included high time cost (39.3%), high parenting cost (36.5%) and high education cost (13.5%). Women (aOR 1.49, 95%CI 1.13,1.96) and people with college degree or above (aOR 3.46, 95%CI 2.08, 5.75) were associated with higher prevalence of childrearing barriers, and people who intended to have a second child (aOR 0.58, 95%CI 0.40, 0.83) and people who intended to have a third child (aOR 0.51,95%CI 0.37, 0.71) were less likely to report childrearing barriers. The biggest barrier was more likely to be high time cost for parents one of whom is only child (aOR1.21, 95%CI 1.03, 1.42) and physical factors for parents both of whom are only child (aOR 1.56,95%CI 1.08, 2.26). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of barriers to rearing children aged 0–3 years was high among Chinese people of childbearing age who had children. Full consideration should be given to the barriers of people with different sociodemographic characteristics and people with fertility intention, thus making targeted childrearing policies and supporting measures to reduce the burden on people of childbearing age, encourage suitable couples to have a second or third child and then cope with China’s aging population.

Inflammation is an important contributor to this ongoing risk. Recent studies have shown that the broad-acting anti-inflammatory agent, colchicine, may reduce adverse cardiovascular events in patients post-MI, although the mechanistic basis for this remains unclear. Advances in endovascular arterial wall imaging have allowed detailed characterization of the burden and compositional phenotype of coronary plaque, along with its natural history and responsiveness to treatment. One such example has been the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) to demonstrate the plaque-stabilizing effects of statins on both fibrous cap thickness and the size of lipid pools within plaque. METHODS: The Phase 2, multi-centre, double-blind colchicine for coronary plaque modification in acute coronary syndrome (COCOMO-ACS) study will evaluate the effect of colchicine 0.5 mg daily on coronary plaque features using serial OCT imaging in patients following MI. Recruitment for the trial has been completed with 64 participants with non-ST elevation MI randomized 1:1 to colchicine or placebo in addition to guideline recommended therapies, including high-intensity statins. The primary endpoint is the effect of colchicine on the minimal fibrous cap thickness of non-culprit plaque over an 18-month period. SUMMARY: The COCOMO-ACS study will determine whether addition of colchicine 0.5 mg daily to standard post-MI treatment has incremental benefits on high-risk features of coronary artery plaques. If confirmed, this will provide new mechanistic insights into how colchicine may confer clinical benefits in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

This large number of active cases is putting the medical facilities under severe strain. Many researchers have proposed many ways of forecasting the COVID-19 patients but they mainly worked on the cumulative cases and moreover, all those methods required considerable skill and computational cost. In this work, a simple spreadsheet-based forecasting model has been developed which will help to predict the number of active cases in the immediate future i.e., the next few days. This information can be useful for emergency management. The difficulty which is generally faced in predicting the active cases is that the dynamics of active cases has a complex dependence on a number of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) and social factors and can undergo sharp changes. Quadratic, cubic and quartic polynomial functions have been applied to capture these peaks and observed that the quadratic function helps in better prediction of the peak. The accuracy of the prediction methods is measured as well as it is tried to observe how the methods predict data for the next 1 day, 3 days and 6 days. A prediction method analogous to weather forecasting method is recommended in this work where the prediction for each day gets updated depending on the most recent data available.

COVID-19 ranges in severity of symptoms which are related to the inflammatory response. Although the field has progressed significantly, there is still a critical gap in understanding virus-host lipid interactions that contribute to viral assembly and budding of this lipid-enveloped virus. There are four structural proteins encoded in the SARS-CoV-2 genome: membrane, envelope (E), nucleocapsid, and spike. These proteins give shape to the bilayer lipid coat that encapsulate the genomic core necessary for virus infection and replication. These proteins are essential for viral reproduction but how they interact with each other and how lipid species regulate their assembly is not well understood. It is established that inflammation is common during infection. One enzyme that participates in this process is ceramide kinase (CERK), which synthesizes the pro-inflammatory lipid, ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P). CERK is in fact a therapeutic target for a variety of inflammatory disorders. My primary goal is to define the relationship between CERK activity and SARS-CoV-2 assembly. We aim to understand the impact that CERK activity has on the localization and assembly of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. I am interested in how CERK regulates E protein localization and formation of virus-like particles and the process by which E-lipid interactions contributes to membrane curvature changes necessary for formation of new viral particles.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective controlled cohort study. METHODS All tonsillectomies performed by practice physicians during the period January 1, 2010 to August 31, 2019 were identified. Three groups were created based on surgeon technique utilization: the study group (VLET) and two control groups (exclusive standard energy monopolar [Standard]; exclusive ""hot"" technique without exclusive monopolar use [Mixed ""Hot""]). Each group's PTH occurrences requiring surgical intervention (PTHRSI) were identified and rates compared. RESULTS During the study period 11,348 tonsillectomies were performed (4,427 Standard, 1,374 VLET, 5,547 Mixed ""Hot""), and 167 (1.47%) PTHRSI events identified (14 primary (<24 hours), 153 secondary (>24 hours), 12 repeat (>1PTHRSI/patient). Compared to the Standard group secondary and total PTHRSI rates (1.47%, 1.60%), the Mixed ""Hot"" group experienced similar rates (1.57%, P = .54; 1.68%, P = .64), but the VLET group experienced significantly lower rates (0.15%, P = .0026, adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.114 [0.028-0.469]; 0.22%, P = .0016, adjusted OR 0.155 [0.048-0.494]). Age was a significant risk factor for both secondary and total PTHRSI (P = .0025, P = .0024, adjusted OR 1.02/year [1.01-1.03]). No significant difference in rate of primary PTHRSI was seen collectively or in any age group. The <12VLET Group experienced 0 episodes of secondary PTHRSI and a total PTHRSI rate of 0.09% in 1060 tonsillectomies. CONCLUSIONS Standard energy techniques had an adjusted odds ratio over 8-fold higher for secondary PTHRSI and over 6-fold higher for total PTHRSI compared to the minimized energy transfer VLET technique.

MicroRNA miR-30a acts as a tumor suppressor gene in most tumors and participates in the development of various cancers. However, its role in hydatidiform moles is not clear. METHODS Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR was used to verify the expression level of miR-30a and STOX2 (encoding storkhead box 2). Flow cytometry assays were performed to detect the cell cycle in cell with different expression levels of miR-30a and STOX2. Cell Cycle Kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, and colony formation assays were used to detect cell proliferation and viability. Transwell assays was used to test cell invasion and migration. Dual-luciferase reporter assays and western blotting were used to investigate the potential mechanisms involved. RESULT Low miR-30a expression promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of trophoblastic cells (JAR and HTR-8). Dual luciferase assays confirmed that STOX2 is a target of miR-30a and resisted the effect of upregulated miR-30a in trophoblastic cells. In addition, downregulation of STOX2 by miR-30a could activate ERK, AKT, and P38 signaling pathways. These results revealed a new mechanism by which ERK, AKT, and P38 activation by miR-30a/STOX2 results in excessive proliferation of trophoblast cells in the hydatidiform mole. CONCLUSIONS In this study, we found that miR-30a plays an important role in the development of the hydatidiform mole. Our findings indicate that miR-30a might promote the malignant transformation of human trophoblastic cells by regulating STOX2, which strengthens our understanding of the role of miR-30a in regulating trophoblastic cell transformation.",2022-03-04,"Guo, Zhenzhen; Zhu, Chenyu; Wang, Youhui; Li, Zhen; Wang, Lu; Fan, Jianhui; Xu, Yuefei; Zou, Na; Kong, Ying; Li, Dong; Sui, Linlin",Cancer cell international,,,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12935-022-02503-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35246136/,247233644.0,2022,251

Yet, biotic and abiotic environmental factors can strongly affect disease dynamics, and ultimately, host–parasite coevolution. Here, we review research on how environmental context alters virulence–transmission relationships, focusing on the off-host portion of the parasite life cycle, and how variation in parasite survival affects the evolution of virulence and transmission. We review three inter-related ‘approaches’ that have dominated the study of the evolution of virulence and transmission for different host–parasite systems: (i) evolutionary trade-off theory, (ii) parasite local adaptation and (iii) parasite phylodynamics. These approaches consider the role of the environment in virulence and transmission evolution from different angles, which entail different advantages and potential biases. We suggest improvements to how to investigate virulence–transmission relationships, through conceptual and methodological developments and taking environmental context into consideration.

In many hospitals and health care facilities, services and health care workers have been reorganized and restructured to meet the demands of the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on hospital‐based clinical pharmacists and their ability to deliver pharmaceutical care is currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on hospital‐based clinical pharmacists working in Malaysia and the implications on how clinical pharmacy is perceived as a health care service. METHODS: A qualitative study was designed to meet the research objectives. Nineteen hospital‐based clinical pharmacists consented and participated in one‐on‐one, semi‐structured interviews. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using an iterative thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: The experiences and views of the participants were reported. Three main themes were developed: ‘Reassignment and other changes in clinical pharmacist roles’, ‘Adapting clinical pharmacy services to COVID‐19’, and ‘The need for clinical pharmacists in the ward’. The findings indicate that in many cases, clinical pharmacy services were fully or partially withdrawn from the ward to reduce the risk of infection and to conserve the usage of personal protective equipment. Despite this, clinical pharmacists continued to support patient care in hospitals through the use of technology. The withdrawal of clinical pharmacy services, however, raises concern that the role of clinical pharmacists is still poorly recognized. CONCLUSION: Clinical pharmacists in hospitals continue to support patient care despite the disruption caused by the COVID‐19 pandemic. Greater support and recognition of their role is required in order to empower and enhance their ability to deliver pharmaceutical care. This article is protected by copyright.

In order to better tackle COVID-19 it is important to determine how the general population perceive the sharing of medical information on social media platforms. Based on this, the aim of the study is to analyse the perception of Saudi Arabian Health Care Workers’ (HCWs) and Non-Health Care Workers’ (NHCWs) regarding the sharing and resharing of medical information, whether true or false, on social media platforms regarding COVID-19. METHODS: To achieve the aim of this study, the general objective is to identify the most commonly used Social Media Platforms, determine the proportion of the Saudi Arabian population who have participated in recirculating information in those social media platforms, and to analyse their perception of medical information sharing in social media platforms. This study was conducted using a quantitative research methodology. The measurement tool used for this study was an online survey conducted using Google Survey. A 10-item questionnaire was adopted and translated to Arabic to conduct the survey. RESULTS: The total number of responses for the study were N=1249. The findings of the study indicate that Saudi Arabian general population understand the prevalence of unverified information, but are accepting of the practice of sharing information without evidence on social media platforms, with the belief that such information does not cause actual harm to the general public, but instead would be beneficial. WhatsApp was the most preferred social media platform for receiving and sharing information among participants, followed by Twitter and Snapchat. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that the Saudi Arabian population are more wary than the global general population regarding misinformation online on social media platforms regarding COVID-19.",2021-09-01,"Alshareef, Maram; Alotiby, Amna",Int J Gen Med,,document_parses/pdf_json/5c89877e48b9e2bdab0f8dcdcc6ac0b0a17b944c.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511995/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s326767,237467714.0,2021,293

The basic reproductive rate (R(0)) for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 2·5 (range 1·8–3·6) compared with 2·0–3·0 for SARS-CoV and the 1918 influenza pandemic, 0·9 for MERS-CoV, and 1·5 for the 2009 influenza pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 causes mild or asymptomatic disease in most cases; however, severe to critical illness occurs in a small proportion of infected individuals, with the highest rate seen in people older than 70 years. The measured case fatality rate varies between countries, probably because of differences in testing strategies. Population-based mortality estimates vary widely across Europe, ranging from zero to high. Numbers from the first affected region in Italy, Lombardy, show an all age mortality rate of 154 per 100 000 population. Differences are most likely due to varying demographic structures, among other factors. However, this new virus has a focal dissemination; therefore, some areas have a higher disease burden and are affected more than others for reasons that are still not understood. Nevertheless, early introduction of strict physical distancing and hygiene measures have proven effective in sharply reducing R(0) and associated mortality and could in part explain the geographical differences.",2020-07-03,"Petersen, Eskild; Koopmans, Marion; Go, Unyeong; Hamer, Davidson H; Petrosillo, Nicola; Castelli, Francesco; Storgaard, Merete; Al Khalili, Sulien; Simonsen, Lone",Lancet Infect Dis,,document_parses/pdf_json/de6cbe566b54f18f369c1ab8f8c1d0a9af1d6242.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309920304849; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309920304849; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32628905/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(20)30484-9,220323842.0,2020,231

METHODS: We compared our planning and experience at a tertiary care academic medical center to recommendations in the literature. RESULTS: Published literature and our experience underscored the need to plan for adequate dialysis equipment, particularly for continuous renal replacement therapy in the ICU setting, adequate nursing, and flexible scheduling of chronic patients to accommodate the surge in acute patients. We discovered other “shortages” not mentioned in the literature: shortages in the number of portable reverse osmosis (RO) machines needed to prepare dialysis water, inadequate number of rooms in units designated for COVID-19 patients with plumbing for dialysis, and lack of temperature blending valves on sinks that necessitated using cold water only, and damaging the RO membranes. We identified the need for cooperation between nephrology and critical care medicine, hospital-based and community nephrologists and community dialysis units as well as nephrologists at other hospitals in the region. We turned to guidance from the hospital ethics committee. CONCLUSION: Planning for an expected surge in hospitalized patients requiring RRT demands coordination between critical care, dialysis and nursing services as well as community and hospital providers to make certain there are adequate dialysis resources. Our experience suggests that continuous dialysis is in greatest demand early in the illness, and that plans to increase supplies should be put in place. But, planning should also focus on unforeseen hospital-specific infrastructure shortages that can develop over time and hamper intermittent dialysis delivery to all patients who require treatment.",2020-10-21,"Mitchell, Kevin R; Bomm, Alison; Shea, Barry S; Shemin, Douglas; Bayliss, George",Int J Nephrol Renovasc Dis,,document_parses/pdf_json/b14558d7062c5ecab51c52dbb29ef8a9ca877fc1.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33116756/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijnrd.s275075,225076676.0,2020,262

The extended Theory of Planned Behavior model was consequently tested by empirical data collected from 110 rural female facilitators in Qom Province in the center of Iran. The results of structural equation modeling indicated that subjective norms and environmental attitude were positively and significantly related to pro-environmental intentions. In addition, pro-environmental intentions and perceived behavioral control were found to be significantly associated with pro-environmental behaviors. The results revealed that there was a direct and indirect relationship between religiosity and pro-environmental behaviors via perceived behavioral control.

Conventional technologies have several drawbacks (i.e., cross-infection risk, filtration efficiency improvements limited by difficulty in breathing, and no safe reusability), which have yet to be addressed in a single device. Here, we report the development of a filter overcoming the major technical challenges of respiratory protective devices. Large-pore membranes, offering high breathability but low bacteria capture, were functionalized to have a uniform salt layer on the fibers. The salt-functionalized membranes achieved high filtration efficiency as opposed to the bare membrane, with differences of up to 48%, while maintaining high breathability (> 60% increase compared to commercial surgical masks even for the thickest salt filters tested). The salt-functionalized filters quickly killed Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria aerosols in vitro, with CFU reductions observed as early as within 5 min, and in vivo by causing structural damage due to salt recrystallization.

nngcpv8j,,Medline,The Effect of Social Isolation During the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain Who Underwent a Spine Intervention.,,,34323433.0,unk,"BACKGROUND The COVID-19 infection poses a serious threat to global health for millions of people. In addition to therapeutic treatment methods, preventive measures are also important in controlling the pandemic. As a result, billions of people are quarantined in their homes to prevent the spread of coronavirus. However, social isolation may result in immobility, which can lead to musculoskeletal problems and an increased level of pain, depending on the weakness of the muscles. OBJECTIVES To examine the effect of social isolation during the recent COVID-19 pandemic on patients with chronic low back pain. STUDY DESIGN A total of 145 patients who underwent a spine intervention within the past year were enrolled in this prospective and cross-sectional study. SETTING The study was performed in the interventional pain unit of a tertiary rehabilitation center in Turkey. METHODS Patient data were obtained by telephone interview and included information pertaining to demographics, pain history, an assessment of pain, analgesic use, activity levels, and an evaluation of stress and sleep habits. Additionally, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to evaluate patient activity levels. RESULTS It was detected that social isolation has increased the intensity of low back pain experienced by patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that patients who benefited from spinal injections administered in the prepandemic period experience less severe low back pain (P = 0.000) and took fewer analgesics (P = 0.000) during the pandemic. The findings of our study revealed that there was a significant reverse correlation between IPAQ walking scores and the prepandemic Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores (P = 0.015, r = -0.201) and the pandemic VAS scores (P = 0.000, r = -0.313).By contrast, the level of benefit from injections decreased (P < 0.05) and the duration of spinal intervention was shortened in patients with high IPAQ sitting scores (P < 0.05). LIMITATIONS The limitations of the study are the small number of patients and the fact that our results are based on patients' self-reported data. CONCLUSIONS Social isolation has had an increasing effect on low back pain during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of our study showed a significant relationship between activity level and pain intensity. We also found that patients who have benefited from spinal injections administered in the prepandemic period experience less severe low back pain during the pandemic.",2021-08-01,"San, Ayca Uran; Kesikburun, Serdar; Tezel, Kutay",Pain physician,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323433/,236498729.0,2021,387

The hospital stay is one of the prognostic indicators, and its predicting model based on CT radiomics features is important for assessing the patients' clinical outcome. The study aimed to develop and test machine learning-based CT radiomics models for predicting hospital stay in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods This retrospective, multicenter study enrolled patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and their initial CT images from 5 designated hospitals in Ankang, Lishui, Lanzhou, Linxia, and Zhenjiang between January 23, 2020 and February 8, 2020. Patients were classified into short-term (≤10 days) and long-term hospital stay (>10 days). CT radiomics models based on logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF) were developed on features from pneumonia lesions in first four centers. The predictive performance was evaluated in fifth center (test dataset) on lung lobe- and patients-level. Results A total of 52 patients were enrolled from designated hospitals. As of February 20, 21 patients remained in hospital or with non-findings in CT were excluded. Therefore, 31 patients with 72 lesion segments were included in analysis. The CT radiomics models based on 6 second-order features were effective in discriminating short- and long-term hospital stay in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, with areas under the curves of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.83-1.0) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.67-1.0) by LR and RF, respectively, in test. The LR and RF model showed a sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 and 0.89, 0.75 and 1.0 in test respectively. As of February 28, a prospective cohort of six discharged patients were all correctly recognized as long-term stay using RF and LR models.

The growing need for realism in addressing complex public health questions is, however, calling for accurate models of the human contact patterns that govern the disease transmission processes. Here we present a data-driven approach to generate effective population-level contact matrices by using highly detailed macro (census) and micro (survey) data on key socio-demographic features.

The correct diagnosis relies on careful morphologic evaluation, cytogenetic/molecular results, and excluding reactive conditions mimicking MDS. We present the clinical, pathologic, cytogenetic, and molecular features of a case of MDS with excess blasts-2 (MDS-EB-2) in a 30-year-old male who was found to have pancytopenia during his hospitalization for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and discuss the diagnostic challenges of MDS in patients with COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: A 30-year-old man presented to an outside hospital with fever, chills, weakness, coughing spells, dizziness and shortness of breath and was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia due to COVID-19. At the outside hospital, he was found to be pancytopenic, and a subsequent bone marrow aspiration and biopsy raised concern for a COVID-19 induced hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. In addition, MDS could not be ruled out. The patient was thus referred to our institute for further management. The patient’s peripheral blood showed pancytopenia with occasional dysplastic neutrophils and a few teardrop cells. Given the diagnostic uncertainty, a bone marrow aspiration and a biopsy were repeated revealing a hypercellular bone marrow with erythroid hyperplasia, megakaryocytic hyperplasia, trilineage dysplasia, increased blasts (13%), many ring sideroblasts, and mild to moderate myelofibrosis, consistent with MDS-EB-2. Chromosomal analysis revealed isochromosome 14. Next generation sequencing demonstrated SF3B1 K700E mutation. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of MDS can be challenging, particularly in young patients. Cytopenia and myelodysplastic features have been reported in COVID-19 patients, making the diagnosis of MDS more elusive. A careful pathologic examination of the bone marrow with ancillary studies including flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and cytogenetic and molecular studies in combination with a thorough clinical evaluation, leads to the accurate diagnosis.",2021-04-20,"Qing, Xin; Cai, Jennifer; Rock, Adam",Autopsy & case reports,,document_parses/pdf_json/309e5ba44e324dee198294e5cab44e9514791889.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968834/; https://doi.org/10.4322/acr.2021.274,233997044.0,2021,283

Here, we estimate the number of breast cancers whose detection may be delayed because of the suspension, and the potential impact on cancer deaths over 10 years. METHODS: We estimated the number and length of screening delays from observed NHS Breast Screening System data. We then estimated additional breast cancer deaths from three routes: asymptomatic tumours progressing to symptomatically diagnosed disease, invasive tumours which remain screen-detected but at a later date, and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) progressing to invasive disease by detection. We took progression rates, prognostic characteristics, and survival rates from published sources. RESULTS: We estimated that 1,489,237 women had screening delayed by around 2–7 months between July 2020 and June 2021, leaving 745,277 outstanding screens. Depending on how quickly this backlog is cleared, around 2500–4100 cancers would shift from screen-detected to symptomatic cancers, resulting in 148–452 additional breast cancer deaths. There would be an additional 164–222 screen-detected tumour deaths, and 71–97 deaths from DCIS that progresses to invasive cancer.

Data on the evolution of patient’s conditions, antimicrobial therapies, and microbiological data were collected. Whole-genome sequencing performed by Illumina and Nanopore sequencing methods were used to type the strains. During the hospitalization, a SARS-CoV2-infected patient was colonized by a KPC-producing K. pneumoniae strain and empirically treated with ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) when presenting spiking fever symptoms. Successively, ST2502 CZA-resistant strain producing the KPC-31 variant gave a pulmonary infection to the patient. The infection was treated with high doses of meropenem. The KPC-31-producing strain disappeared but the patient remained colonized by a KPC-3-producing K. pneumoniae strain. An interplay between highly conserved KPC-31- and KPC-3-producing ST2502 strains occurred in the SARS-CoV2 patient during the hospitalization, selected by CZA and carbapenem treatments, respectively.

Despite this, chronic conditions are often managed in isolation, potentially leading to burden-capacity imbalance and reduced treatment adherence. We aimed to explore, in a low-income population with common comorbidities, how the specific demands of multimorbidity affect burden and capacity as defined by the Cumulative Complexity Model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Qualitative interviews with thirteen rural community health centre patients in Victoria, Australia. Participants were aged between 47–72 years and reported 3–10 chronic conditions. We asked about perceived capacity and burden in managing health. The Theory of Patient Capacity was used to analyse capacity and Normalisation Process Theory to analyse burden. All data specifically associated with the experience of multimorbidity was extracted from each burden and capacity domain. RESULTS: The capacity domains of biography, resource mobilisation and work realisation were important in relation to multimorbidity. Conditions causing functional impairment (e.g. chronic pain, depression) interacted with physical, psychological and financial capacity, leading to biographical disruption and an inability to realise treatment and life work. Despite this, few people had a treatment plan for these conditions. Participants reported that multimorbidity affected all burden domains. Coherence and appraisal were especially challenging due to condition interactions, with clinicians providing little guidance. DISCUSSION: The capacity and burden deficits highlighted by participants were not associated with any specific diagnosis, but were due to condition interactions, coupled with the lack of health provider support to navigate interactions. Physical, psychological and financial capacities were inseparable, but rarely addressed or understood holistically. Understanding and managing condition and treatment interactions was a key burden task for patients but was often difficult, isolating and overwhelming. This suggests that clinicians should become more aware of linkages between conditions, and include generic, synergistic or cross-disciplinary approaches, to build capacity, reduce burden and encourage integrated chronic condition management.",2021-08-09,"Hardman, Ruth; Begg, Stephen; Spelten, Evelien",PLoS One,,document_parses/pdf_json/ae89fba875b78cb9d2a37a2b409f5e716825eb7d.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8351969/,,2021,302

This health crisis has resulted in a significant effort to stop the spread of this new coronavirus. However, while propagating itself in the human population, the virus accumulates mutations and generates new variants with increased fitness and the ability to escape the human immune response. Here we describe a color-based barcoded spike flow cytometric assay (BSFA) that is particularly useful to evaluate and directly compare the humoral immune response directed against either wild type (WT) or mutant spike (S) proteins or the receptor-binding domains (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. This assay employs the human B lymphoma cell line Ramos, transfected for stable expression of WT or mutant S proteins or a chimeric RBD-CD8 fusion protein. We find that the alpha and beta mutants are more stably expressed than the WT S protein on the Ramos B cell surface and/or bind with higher affinity to the viral entry receptor ACE2. However, we find a reduce expression of the chimeric RBD-CD8 carrying the point mutation N501Y and E484K characteristic for the alpha and beta variant, respectively. The comparison of the humoral immune response of 12 vaccinated probands with 12 COVID-19 patients shows that after the boost, the S-specific IgG class immune response in the vaccinated group is similar to that of the patient group. However, in comparison to WT the specific IgG serum antibodies bind less well to the alpha variant and only poorly to the beta variant S protein. This is in line with the notion that the beta variant is an immune escape variant of SARS-CoV-2. The IgA class immune response was more variable than the IgG response and higher in the COVID-19 patients than in the vaccinated group. In summary, we think that our BSFA represents a useful tool to evaluate the humoral immunity against emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 and to analyze new vaccination protocols against these variants.",2021-09-23,"Vesper, Niklas; Ortiz, Yaneth; Bartels-Burgahn, Frauke; Yang, Jianying; de la Rosa, Kathrin; Tenbusch, Matthias; Schulz, Sebastian; Finzel, Stephanie; Jäck, Hans-Martin; Eibel, Hermann; Voll, Reinhard E.; Reth, Michael",Front Immunol,,document_parses/pdf_json/2aa2fa7fd821f42692bee7d94f9e2f40f0911ec9.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.730766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34630410/,237600683.0,2021,331

Therefore, it has been a priority of many pathogens to manipulate the cellular NF-κB activity in order to create a favorable environment for their survival inside the host. RESULTS: We observed that heterologous expression of the open reading frame 2 (ORF2) protein in human hepatoma cells led to stabilization of the cellular I kappa B alpha (IκBα) pool, with a concomitant reduction in the nuclear localization of the p65 subunit of NF-κB and inhibition of NF-κB activity. Although basal or TPA induced phosphorylation of IκBα was not altered, its ubiquitination was markedly reduced in ORF2 expressing cells. Further analysis revealed that ORF2 protein could directly associate with the F-box protein, beta transducin repeat containing protein (βTRCP) and ORF2 over expression resulted in reduced association of IκBα with the SKP1 and CUL1 components of the SCF(βTRCP) complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay of the proximal promoter regions of MHC-I heavy chain and IL-8 genes using p65 antibody and LPS stimulated ORF2 expressing cell extract revealed decreased association of p65 with the above regions, indicating that ORF2 inhibited p65 binding at endogenous promoters.

RECENT FINDINGS There is ample evidence to support elevated Lp(a) levels, present in approximately 20% of the general population, as a causal, independent risk factor for CVD and its role as a significant risk enhancer. Several guidelines and position statements have been published to assist in the identification, treatment and follow-up of adults with elevated levels of Lp(a). There is growing interest in Lp(a) screening and strategies to improve health behaviors starting in youth, although published recommendations for this population are limited. In addition to the well established increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and valvular aortic stenosis, data from the coronavirus pandemic suggest adults with elevated Lp(a) may have a particularly high-risk of cardiovascular complications. Lp(a)-specific-lowering therapies are currently in development. Despite their inability to lower Lp(a), use of statins have been shown to improve outcomes in primary and secondary prevention. SUMMARY Considerable differences exist amongst published guidelines for adults on the use of Lp(a) in clinical practice, and recommendations for youth are limited. With increasing knowledge of Lp(a)'s role in CVD, including recent observations of COVID-19-related risk of cardiovascular complications, more harmonized and comprehensive guidelines for Lp(a) in clinical practice are required.

The plant is rich in simple bisphenyl lignans and tricyclic lignans known as cyclolignans. These compounds are responsible for many of the pharmacological activities of extracts of the plants. Some of these activities, namely antiherpes, antioxidant, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory, were known a century ago. Only recently have further studies revealed other crucial activities of the same plant molecules as powerful agents against human immunodeficiency virus, human papillomavirus, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and symptoms of aging.

To date there is little known about the specificity of plasma cells in COVID-19 patients. This is largely because plasma cells lack surface antibody expression, which complicates their screening. Here, we describe a technology pipeline that integrates single-cell antibody repertoire sequencing and high-throughput mammalian display screening to interrogate the specificity of plasma cells from 16 convalescent COVID-19 patients. Single-cell sequencing allows us to profile antibody repertoire features in these patients and identify highly expanded clonal lineages. Mammalian display screening is employed to reveal that 37 antibodies (out of 132 candidates) derived from expanded plasma cell clonal lineages are specific for SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including antibodies that target the receptor binding domain (RBD) with high affinity and exhibit potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2.

However, no enough epidemiological data is available in this respect in many parts of the country. Hence, this study was aimed at assessing the prevalence of intestinal protozoan parasitic infections and their associated risk factors among school children in Zeita village, Merhabete District, North Shewa Zone, Central Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional parasitological survey was conducted from January to March 2020. A total of 280 children from Zeita primary school were selected using stratified random sampling techniques. Stool samples were collected and examined using direct wet mount, Formal-Ether concentration and Modified Zeihel-Neelsen staining techniques. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of intestinal protozoan parasitic infection was found to be 46.8% (131/280). The three predominant protozoan parasites detected in this study were Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, and Cryptosporidium parvum which were observed in 70 (25.2%), 54 (19.3%), and 7 (2.5%) of the study participants, respectively. Sociodemographic characteristics of the study subjects such as family occupation (P = 0.028), sources of drinking water (P = 0.001), water handling practice (P = 0.027), habit of eating vegetable (P = 0.001), and presence of latrine were observed to be significantly associated risk factors for the occurrence of human intestinal protozoan parasites.

Herein, we used patchouli oil (PO) containing a high amount of patchouli alcohol derived from P. cablin var. Tapak Tuan. The aim of this study was to investigate the antidepressant potential of PO, with a variety of patchouli alcohol concentrations obtained from a separation process using vacuum distillation with different temperature ranges. The initial patchouli oil (iPO) was traditionally distilled by a local farmer and further distilled using a rotary evaporator at temperature ranges of 115–160 °C (POF-1); 120–160 °C (POF-2), and 125–160 °C (POF-3), resulting in products with different patchouli alcohol concentrations. POF-3, with the highest patchouli alcohol content of 60.66% (based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry), was used for cooling crystallization, resulting in 100% patchouli alcohol crystal (pPA). A tail suspension test (TST) was performed on a rat model to screen the antidepressant potential of iPO and its derivatives. The TST results revealed that POF-3 had the best antidepressant-like effect and was second only to the fluoxetine-based antidepressant, Kalxetin(®), where both groups had significant reductions of immobility time post-treatment (p < 0.0001). Other than patchouli alcohol, POF-3 also contained ledol and trans-geraniol, which have been reported for their antidepressant-related activities. Brain dopamine levels increased significantly in the group treated with POF-3 (p < 0.05 as compared with the control group), suggesting its primary anti-depressant mechanism.

The main drivers identified to develop an EHU are: surveillance and monitoring, crisis preparedness, funding, political will, vision of public health expenditures, population’s awareness and interest, and global health. Based on these findings, five scenarios were developed: making a full move towards supranational action; improving efficiency in the actual framework; more coordination but no real change; in a full intergovernmentalism direction; and fragmentation of the EU.

The T1D-predisposing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II molecule, DQ8, binds and presents insulin B chain peptides in the thymus producing autoreactive CD4+ T cells. Here, we show that this process is driven by negatively-charged T cell receptor (TCR) complementarity-determining region 3{beta} (CDR3{beta}) sequences interacting with alanine at position 57 of the DQ8 {beta} chain. Since T1D aetiology is linked to gut microbiota dysbiosis, we hypothesized that the commensal proteome contains mimics of the primary insulin B:9-23 epitope that control TCR selection and tolerance. We identified a large set of bacterial proteins with significant similarity to insulin B:9-25, particularly from the transketolase (TKT) superfamily. We isolated a CD4+ TCR with a negatively-charged CDR3{beta} from the pancreas of a DQ8-positive patient that was cross-reactive with one of these TKT peptides and insulin B:9-23. The T1D-protective molecule, DQ6, with the negatively-charged aspartic acid (D) at DQ{beta}57, showed strong TKT mimotope binding, supporting a role for TKT-specific regulatory T cells in resistance to T1D. We propose that in a DQ8+DQ6- child with a proinflammatory dysbiotic gut microbiota, cross-reactive TKT-insulin B chain peptide T effector cells escape from the thymus and initiate T1D. TKT is a strong candidate because it is highly upregulated during weaning, a key period in T1D aetiology, and hence a prominent target for an autoimmune-prone immune system. Inhibiting gut dysbiosis and improving immune tolerance to TKT and other mimotopes, especially before and during weaning, could be a route to primary prevention of T1D and other common diseases.",2022-05-14,"Rubio Garcia, A.; Paterou, A.; Powell Doherty, R.

However, the term “aerosol” covers most particle sizes of suspended particulates because of information asymmetry in different disciplines, which may lead to misunderstandings in the selection of epidemic prevention and control strategies for the public. In this review, the time when these droplets are exhaled by a patient was taken as the initial time. Then, all available viral loads and numerical distribution of the exhaled droplets was analyzed, and the evaporation model of droplets in the air was combined with the deposition model of droplet nuclei in the respiratory tract. Lastly, the perspective that physical spread affects the transmission risk of different size droplets at different times was summarized for the first time. The results showed that although the distribution of exhaled droplets was dominated by small droplets, droplet volume was proportional to the third power of particle diameter, meaning that the viral load of a 100 μm droplet was approximately 10(6) times that of a 1 μm droplet at the initial time. Furthermore, the exhaled droplets are affected by heat and mass transfer of evaporation, water fraction, salt concentration, and acid-base balance (the water fraction > 98%), which lead them to change rapidly, and the viral survival condition also deteriorates dramatically. The time required for the initial diameter (d(o)) of a droplet to shrink to the equilibrium diameter (d(e), about 30% of d(o)) is approximately proportional to the second power of the particle diameter, taking only a few milliseconds for a 1 μm droplet but hundreds of milliseconds for a 10 μm droplet; in other words, the viruses carried by the large droplets can be preserved as much as possible. Finally, the infectious droplet nuclei maybe inhaled by the susceptible population through different and random contact routes, and the droplet nuclei with larger d(e) decompose more easily into tiny particles on account of the accelerated collision in a complex airway, which can be deposited in the higher risk alveolar region. During disease transmission, the infectious droplet particle size varies widely, and the transmission risk varies significantly at different time nodes; therefore, the fuzzy term “aerosol” is not conducive to analyzing disease exposure risk. Recommendations for epidemic prevention and control strategies are: 1) Large droplets are the main conflict in disease transmission; thus, even if they are blocked by a homemade mask initially, it significantly contains the epidemic. 2) The early phase of contact, such as close-contact and short-range transmission, has the highest infection risk; therefore, social distancing can effectively keep the susceptible population from inhaling active viruses. 3) The risk of the fomite route depends on the time in contact with infectious viruses; thus, it is important to promote good health habits (including frequent hand washing, no-eye rubbing, coughing etiquette, normalization of surface cleaning), although blind and excessive disinfection measures are not advisable. 4) Compared with the large droplets, the small droplets have larger numbers but carry fewer viruses and are more prone to die through evaporation.",2020-09-24,"Mao, N.; An, C.K.; Guo, L.Y.; Wang, M.; Guo, L.; Guo, S.R.; Long, E.S.",Build Environ,,document_parses/pdf_json/635f8e7affa901db90a89cb1fc6f944fe0a6624d.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132320306788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33519041/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107307; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132320306788,224991359.0,2020,512

Many variants of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, some of which have increased transmissibility and/or reduced susceptibility to vaccines. There is an urgent need for variant phenotyping for epidemiological surveillance of circulating lineages. Whole-genome sequencing is the gold standard for identifying SARS-CoV-2 variants, which constitutes a major bottleneck in developing countries. Methodological simplification could increase epidemiological surveillance feasibility and efficiency. We designed a novel multiplex real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2 variants with S gene mutations. This multiplex PCR typing method was established to detect 9 mutations with specific primers and probes (ΔHV 69/70, K417T, K417N, L452R, E484K, E484Q, N501Y, P681H, and P681R) against the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variants. In silico analyses showed high specificity of the assays. Variants of concern (VOC) typing results were found to be highly specific for our intended targets, with no cross-reactivity observed with other upper respiratory viruses. The PCR-based typing methods were further validated using whole-genome sequencing and a commercial kit that was applied to clinical samples of 250 COVID-19 patients from Taiwan. The screening of these samples allowed the identification of epidemic trends by time intervals, including B.1.617.2 in the third Taiwan wave outbreak. This PCR typing strategy allowed the detection of five major variants of concern and also provided an open-source PCR assay which could rapidly be deployed in laboratories around the world to enhance surveillance for the local emergence and spread of B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.617.2 variants and of four Omicron mutations on the spike protein (ΔHV 69/70, K417N, N501Y, P681H). IMPORTANCE COVID-19 has spread globally. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) are leading the next waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies have pointed out that these VOCs may have increased infectivity, have reduced vaccine susceptibility, change treatment regimens, and increase the difficulty of epidemic prevention policy. Understanding SARS-CoV-2 variants remains an issue of concern for all local government authorities and is critical for establishing and implementing effective public health measures. A novel SARS-CoV-2 variant identification method based on a multiplex real-time RT-PCR was developed in this study. Five SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron) were identified simultaneously using this method. PCR typing can provide rapid testing results with lower cost and higher feasibility, which is well within the capacity for any diagnostic laboratory. Characterizing these variants and their mutations is important for tracking SAR-CoV-2 evolution and is conducive to public infection control and policy formulation strategies.",2022-02-23,"Chung, Hsing-Yi; Jian, Ming-Jr; Chang, Chih-Kai; Lin, Jung-Chung; Yeh, Kuo-Ming; Chen, Chien-Wen; Hsieh, Shan-Shan; Hung, Kuo-Sheng; Tang, Sheng-Hui; Perng, Cherng-Lih; Chang, Feng-Yee; Wang, Chih-Hung; Shang, Hung-Sheng",Microbiol Spectr,,document_parses/pdf_json/3b52795a04dd340feceaafd5b8ad2e503fd12def.json,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.02513-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35196812/,247059162.0,2022,421

As these patients may experience a broad range of symptoms, as do patients infected with the related SARS‐CoV‐1 virus, we set up a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic involving pulmonologists, internists, and geriatricians. Patients were allocated to a specialist based on symptoms reported on a self‐developed questionnaire of expected symptoms of COVID‐19. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of this outpatient clinic. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the medical records of patients who presented to the outpatient clinic for follow‐up after hospitalization for COVID‐19 up to 31 August 2020, were reviewed. RESULTS: In total, 266 patients were seen at the outpatient clinic at least once. Overall, 100 patients were seen by a pulmonologist, 97 by an internist, and 65 by a geriatrician. A referral between these 3 medical specialists was needed for only 14 patients (5.3%). Fifty patients were seen by a psychologist, mostly those with a HADS score >10. Only 5 (2.2%) of the 221 patients who were not directly referred to a psychologist based on triage needed psychological support. Forty‐eight patients (18%) were also seen by a physiatrist.

One of the 3D-HEVC novel tools is the DIS tool, which is used to efficiently compress smooth and homogeneous areas of depth maps by using four different prediction modes. The decision of which DIS mode will be used is done through the SVDC similarity criterion in the DIS original definition. This article proposes the substitution of the complex SVDC criterion for simpler and more hardware friendly criteria as SATD, SSE, and SAD. These alternative criteria were evaluated in terms of encoding efficiency and hardware impacts in comparison with the SVDC. Dedicated DIS hardware were designed using each one of each criterion and these designs were described in VHDL and synthesized for TSMC 40 nm. The best results were found with SAD criteria, with losses of only 0.2% in coding efficiency and with expressive gains of more than 50 times in power and more than 35 times in area, when compared with SVDC. The reached results showed that the use of a simpler similarity criterion is an important alternative to be used in DIS tool, mainly if an efficient hardware design is required.",2021-07-03,"Borges, Vinicius A.; Perleberg, Murilo R.; Afonso, Vladimir; Porto, Marcelo S.; Agostini, Luciano V.",Analog Integr Circuits Signal Process,,document_parses/pdf_json/31ff347d342b1b7b0ba4b889e0291ac0e9c886a6.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34248282/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10470-021-01911-1,235756355.0,2021,191

Here, we use in-depth RNA sequencing of Mycobacterium bovis BCG from human THP-1 macrophages to describe the mycobacterial adaptations to the intracellular environment. We identify 329 significantly differentially regulated genes, highlighting cholesterol catabolism, the methylcitrate cycle and iron homeostasis as important for mycobacteria inside macrophages. Examination of multi-functional gene families revealed that 35 PE/PPE genes and five cytochrome P450 genes were upregulated 24 h after infection, highlighting pathways of potential significance. Comparison of the intracellular transcriptome to gene essentiality and immunogenicity studies identified 15 potential targets that are both required for intracellular survival and induced on infection, and eight upregulated genes that have been demonstrated to be immunogenic in TB patients.

For many states, a surge in COVID-19 cases meant planning for the allocation of scarce resources. Crisis standards of care planning focuses on maintaining high-quality clinical care amid extreme operating conditions. One of the primary goals of crisis standards of care planning is to use all preventive measures available to avoid reaching crisis conditions and the complex triage decisionmaking involved therein. Strategies to stay out of crisis must respond to the actual experience of people on the frontlines, or the ""ground truth,"" to ensure efforts to increase critical care bed numbers and augment staff, equipment, supplies, and medications to provide an effective response to a public health emergency. Successful management of a surge event where healthcare needs exceed capacity requires coordinated strategies for scarce resource allocation. In this article, we examine the ground truth challenges encountered in response efforts during the fall surge of 2020 for 2 states-Nebraska and California-and the strategies each state used to enable healthcare facilities to stay out of crisis standards of care. Through these 2 cases, we identify key tools deployed to reduce surge and barriers to coordinated statewide support of the healthcare infrastructure.

Objective: To identify diagnosed symptoms, diagnosed health conditions and medications associated with PASC in children. Design, Setting and Participants: Retrospective cohort study using electronic health records from 9 US children's hospitals for individuals <21 years-old who underwent reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 between March 1, 2020 to October 31, 2021 and had at least 1 encounter in the 3 years before testing. Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity. Main Outcomes and Measures: We identified syndromic (symptoms), systemic (conditions), and medication PASC features in the 28-179 days following the initial test date. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were obtained for 151 clinically predicted PASC features by contrasting PCR-positive with PCR-negative groups using proportional hazards models, adjusting for site, age, sex, testing location, race/ethnicity, and time-period of cohort entrance. We estimated the incidence proportion for any syndromic, systemic or medication PASC feature in the two groups to obtain a burden of PASC estimate. Results: Among 659,286 children in the study sample, 59,893 (9.1%) tested positive by PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Most were tested in outpatient testing facility (50.3%) or office (24.6%) settings. The most common syndromic, systemic, and medication features were loss of taste or smell (aHR 1.96 [95% CI 1.16-3.32), myocarditis (aHR 3.10 [95% CI 1.94-4.96]), and cough and cold preparations (aHR 1.52 [95% CI 1.18-1.96]). The incidence of at least one systemic/syndromic/medication feature of PASC was 41.9% among PCR-positive children versus 38.2% among PCR-negative children, with an incidence proportion difference of 3.7% (95% CI 3.2-4.2%). A higher strength of association for PASC was identified in those cared for in the ICU during the acute illness phase, children less than 5 years-old, and individuals with complex chronic conditions. Conclusions and Relevance: In this large-scale, exploratory study, the burden of pediatric PASC that presented to health systems was low.

Method: From a meta-analysis of external quality assessments of RT-PCR assays of RNA viruses, we derived a conservative estimate of the range of false positive rates that can reasonably be expected in SARS-CoV-2 testing, and analyzed the effect of such rates on analyses of regional test data and estimates of population prevalence and asymptomatic ratio. Findings: Review of external quality assessments revealed false positive rates of 0-16.7%, with an interquartile range of 0.8-4.0%. Such rates would have large impacts on test data when prevalence is low. Inclusion of such rates significantly alters four published analyses of population prevalence and asymptomatic ratio. Interpretation: The high false discovery rate that results, when prevalence is low, from false positive rates typical of RT-PCR assays of RNA viruses raises questions about the usefulness of mass testing; and indicates that across a broad range of likely prevalences, positive test results are more likely to be wrong than are negative results, contrary to public health advice about SARS-CoV-2 testing. There are myriad clinical and case management implications. Failure to appreciate the potential frequency of false positives and the consequent unreliability of positive test results across a range of scenarios could unnecessarily remove critical workers from service, expose uninfected individuals to greater risk of infection, delay or impede appropriate medical treatment, lead to inappropriate treatment, degrade patient care, waste personal protective equipment, waste human resources in unnecessary contact tracing, hinder the development of clinical improvements, and weaken clinical trials.

Videoconferencing is a common telehealth modality for delivering psychotherapy and has demonstrated similar outcomes to those of face-to-face therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most common psychotherapy evaluated across various telehealth modalities; however, studies on CBT delivered via videoconference, particularly in a group therapy format, are lacking. Further, little research exists on videoconference group CBT for anxiety disorders. Accordingly, the present study compared the outcomes of group CBT for anxiety and related disorders delivered via videoconference versus face-to-face. METHOD Using a non-randomized design, data on attendance, dropout, clinical outcomes, and functional impairment were collected from 413 adult outpatients of a tertiary care anxiety disorders clinic who attended a CBT group for panic disorder/agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or obsessive-compulsive disorder delivered either face-to-face (pre-COVID-19 pandemic) or via videoconference (since the onset of COVID-19 pandemic). Outcomes were assessed using well-validated self-report measures. Data were collected pre-treatment, across 12 weekly sessions, and post-treatment. Intent-to-treat analyses were applied to symptom outcome measures. RESULTS Face-to-face CBT conferred only a slight benefit over videoconference CBT for symptom outcomes across all groups, but when assessed individually, only the GAD group showed greater symptom improvement in the face-to-face format. Effect sizes for significant differences between the delivery formats were small. Participants in videoconference groups tended to have slightly higher attendance rates in some instances, whereas functional improvement and treatment dropout were comparable across the delivery formats.

Many patients exhibit cognitive deficits, particularly during disease flare. The connection between colonic inflammation and neuroinflammation remains unclear and characterization of the neuroinflammatory phenotype in the brain during colitis is ill-defined. METHODS: Transgenic mice expressing a bioluminescent reporter of active caspase-1 were treated with 2% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 7 days to induce acute colitis, and colonic, systemic and neuroinflammation were assessed. In some experiments, mice were prophylactically treated with paquinimod (ABR-215757) to inhibit S100A9 inflammatory signaling. As a positive control for peripheral-induced neuroinflammation, mice were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Colonic, systemic and brain inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were measured by cytokine bead array (CBA) and Proteome profiler mouse cytokine array. Bioluminescence was quantified in the brain and caspase activation was confirmed by immunoblot. Immune cell infiltration into the CNS was measured by flow cytometry, while light sheet microscopy was used to monitor changes in resident microglia localization in intact brains during DSS or LPS-induced neuroinflammation. RNA sequencing was performed to identify transcriptomic changes occurring in the CNS of DSS-treated mice. Expression of inflammatory biomarkers were quantified in the brain and serum by qRT-PCR, ELISA and WB. RESULTS: DSS-treated mice exhibited clinical hallmarks of colitis, including weight loss, colonic shortening and inflammation in the colon. We also detected a significant increase in inflammatory cytokines in the serum and brain, as well as caspase and microglia activation in the brain of mice with ongoing colitis. RNA sequencing of brains isolated from DSS-treated mice revealed differential expression of genes involved in the regulation of inflammatory responses. This inflammatory phenotype was similar to the signature detected in LPS-treated mice, albeit less robust and transient, as inflammatory gene expression returned to baseline following cessation of DSS. Pharmacological inhibition of S100A9, one of the transcripts identified by RNA sequencing, attenuated colitis severity and systemic and neuroinflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that local inflammation in the colon drives systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation, and this can be ameliorated by inhibition of the S100 alarmin, S100A9.

We also check the role played in virus propagation by a large religious meeting that gathered over 2000 participants from all over France mid-February in Mulhouse. Results: Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 was circulating several weeks before the first officially recognized case in Alsace on 26 February 2020 and the sanitary alert on 3 March 2020. The religious gathering seems to have played a role for secondary dissemination of the epidemic in France, but not in creating the local outbreak.

This implies that the number of deaths per 100 infected individuals is approximately the same across diverse countries and can be estimated from the slope of the mortality level-infection level plot. The correlation presented here can potentially be combined with estimates of infection spread to forecast future mortality levels and therefore future needs in terms of healthcare and other resources.

This study aimed to investigate the factors impacting the rates of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Jordan, in addition to examining the relationship between COVID-19 risk perception and vaccine acceptance among the Jordanian population. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample of adults (aged ≥18) residing in Jordan. Data were collected using an online questionnaire disseminated using social media platforms between December 2nd and December 29th, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 2,268 (72.3%) participants demonstrated willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The mean COVID-19 risk perception score among the participants was 4.65 out of 10 (median 5; IQR 3–6). Higher risk perception scores were significantly associated with being female (p = .001), young (p < .001), or a smoker (p = .005). A significant positive correlation was identified between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and risk perception scores (OR = 1.319, 95%, CI = 1.261–1.380, p < .001). Moreover, male participants (75%, OR = 1.220, 95% CI = 1.007–1.479, p = .043), participants aged 18–24 years (78.1%, OR = 1.635, 95% CI = 1.189–2.246, p = .002), and participants with children aged under 18 years (73.9%, OR = 1.210, 95% CI = 1.010–1.450, p = .039) were more willing than their counterparts to get vaccinated. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception and certain sociodemographic characteristics (i.e., being male, being young, and having children aged under 18 years) were found to be significantly associated with vaccine acceptance.

As the number of COVID-19 cases stabilized and endoscopy units started re-opening, more patients and healthcare workers faced potential viral exposure. This study aims to assess our experience and outcomes among patients undergoing outpatient endoscopic procedures in a tertiary care setting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: After getting Pennsylvania State approval, our tertiary care center re-opened its outpatient endoscopy unit May 2020 with patient safety protocols in accordance with joint gastrointestinal society guidelines. These included assessment for COVID-19 symptoms 14 days after an endoscopic procedure. Patients undergoing outpatient endoscopy were contacted 14-51 days post procedure to detect COVID-19 symptom development and the result of any subsequent COVID testing. Symptoms included fever, chills, shortness of breath, muscle aches, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or rhinorrhea, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. Patient experiences were documented. Results: From 5/2020 through 7/2020, 1641 patients underwent pre-procedure COVID-19 testing for outpatient endoscopy. The community positive rate was 19% 5/1/2020, declining to 3.8% 7/30/2020. Twelve patients tested positive and were cancelled. Of the 1584 patients who completed an outpatient endoscopy, 997 (62.9%) were successfully contacted post-procedure. Sixty-four (6.4%) patients reported onset of new symptoms seen in COVID-19 (Table 1). Five (0.5%) patients reported being diagnosed with COVID-19. Two asymptomatic patients tested positive 12-13 days post-procedure during elective testing for an additional procedure or travel. Two patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 over 1 month after their procedure. One patient reported onset of symptoms and positive testing 22 days post-procedure. Almost all (99.7%) patients felt safe and believed hospital staff used appropriate safety measures during their procedure (Table 2). While 113 (23.9%) patients were apprehensive to undergo a procedure in May to late June, only 38 (7.3%) shared this worry in the months of late June to July. Of the 74 patients who provided constructive feedback, there were multiple negative comments regarding the logistics of pre-procedure COVID testing. Conclusion: These data suggest outpatient endoscopy is safe for patients when adhering to recommended guidelines. Of the 3 patients with positive COVID-19 testing within 1 month of a procedure, 2 were asymptomatic and 1 had onset of symptoms 22 days after their procedure. It is difficult to implicate outpatient endoscopy as their exposure. While a larger portion of patients were apprehensive about having a procedure during the early months of the pandemic, these fears alleviated in later months.

Viruses including human metapneumovirus (hMPV) account for most ARTIs. The virus causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections mostly in young children and contributes to hospitalization of individuals with asthma,chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and cancer. Moreover, hMPV pauses a considerable socio-economic impact creating a substantial disease burden wherever it has been studied, although hMPV testing is relatively new in many countries. We aimed to comprehensively analyze the epidemiological aspects including prevalence, disease burden and seasonality of hMPV infections in children in the world. We acquired published data extracted from PubMed and PubMed Central articles using the title and abstract (TIAB)search strategy for the major key words on hMPV infections from 9/54 African, 11/35 American, 20/50 Asian, 2/14 Australian/Oceanian and 20/51 European countries.

It enhanced the expression of multiple genes in the NF-κB signaling pathway and promoted the production of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. TILRR is an extracellular matrix protein and expressed in cells and tissues, and has never been considered to exist in the blood. The study aimed to identify circulating TILRR protein in human plasma as a biomarker of systemic inflammation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a multiplex bead array method (Bio-Plex) using 4 monoclonal antibodies targeting different protein domains of FREM1/TILRR to investigate whether TILRR can be detected in blood plasma. The results of the multiplex bead array method were validated by Western blot analysis of affinity-purified TILRR from patient plasma samples. We subsequently analyzed 640 plasma samples from women enrolled in the Pumwani Sex Worker cohort (PSWC) (Nairobi, Kenya). Our study showed that TILRR exists in all patient plasma samples, but its quantities vary greatly among the patients, ranging from 2.38 ng/mL to 5196.79 ng/mL. The plasma TILRR below 2.38 ng/mL can only be detected by affinity purification and Western blot analysis. CONCLUSION: Our in-house developed multiplex bead array method can successfully quantify TILRR protein in plasma samples.

The methods underlying the in vitro study of many CVD biomarkers, including cardiac troponins (cTnI and cTnT), are imperfect and are continually being improved to enhance their analytical performance, with sensitivity and specificity being the most important. Recently developed improved cTnI and cTnT detection methods, referred to as highly sensitive methods (hs-cTnI, hs-cTnT), have changed many of our ideas about the biology of cardiac troponins and opened up a number of additional diagnostic capabilities for practical healthcare. This article systematizes some relevant data on the biology of cardiac troponins as well as on methods for determining cTnI and cTnT with an analysis of the diagnostic value of their analytical characteristics (limit of blank, limit of detection, 99th percentile, coefficient of variation, and others). Data on extracardiac expression of cTnI and cTnT, mechanisms of formation and potential clinical significance of gender, age, and circadian characteristics of hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT content in serum are discussed. Considerable attention is paid to the discussion of new diagnostic capabilities of hs-cTnI, hs-cTnT, including consideration of promising possibilities for their study in biological fluids that can be obtained by non-invasive methods. Also, some possibilities of using hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT as prognostic laboratory biomarkers in healthy people (for example, to assess the risk of developing CVD) and in patients suffering from a number of pathological conditions that cause damage to cardiomyocytes are examined, and the potential mechanisms underlying the increase in hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT are discussed.",2021-06-03,"Chaulin, Aleksey",Vasc Health Risk Manag,,document_parses/pdf_json/e8fa105e2e11cd7749ef1d30968cf264c5063dcf.json,https://doi.org/10.2147/vhrm.s300002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34113117/,235392095.0,2021,257

Many nations are employing combinations of containment and mitigation strategies, where early diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital in controlling illness progression and limiting viral spread within the population. Thus, rapid and accurate methods of early detection are vital to contain COVID-19 and prevent further spread and predicted subsequent infectious waves of viral recurrence in future. Immediately after its initial characterization, Chinese and American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) rapidly employed molecular assays for detection of COVID-19, mostly employing real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) methods. However, such methods require specific expensive items of equipment and highly trained analysts, requiring upwards of 4-8 hours to process. These requirements coupled with associated financial pressures may prevent effective deployment of such diagnostic tests. Loop mediated isothermal amplification(LAMP) is method of nucleic acid amplification which exhibits increased sensitivity and specificity are significantly rapid, and do not require expensive reagents or instruments, which aids in cost reduction for coronavirus detection. Studies have shown the successful application of LAMP assays in various forms to detect coronavirus RNA in patient samples, demonstrating that 1-10 copies of viral RNA template per reaction are sufficient for successful detection, ∼100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR methods. Importantly, studies have also now demonstrated the effectiveness of LAMP methodology in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at significantly low levels, particularly following numerous improvements to LAMP assay protocols. We hypothesise that recent advancements in enhanced LAMP protocols assay perhaps represent the best chance for a rapid and robust assay for field diagnosis of COVID-19, without the requirement of specialized equipment and highly trained professionals to interpret results. Herein, we present our arguments with a view to disseminate such findings, to assist the combat of this virus that is proving so devastating. We hope that this strategy could be applied rapidly, and confirmed for viability with clinical samples, before being rolled out for mass-diagnostic testing in these current times.",2020-04-25,"Kashir, Junaid; Yaqinuddin, Ahmed",Med Hypotheses,,document_parses/pdf_json/caff1d8219b57b6ed9ca6be083d4e7e1a0fd977d.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030698772030596X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S030698772030596X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109786; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361529/,216106595.0,2020,340

One current framework for such solutions proposes to verify claims by retrieving supporting or refuting evidence from related textual sources. However, the realistic use cases for fact-checkers will require verifying claims against evidence sources that could be affected by the same misinformation. Furthermore, the development of modern NLP tools that can produce coherent, fabricated content would allow malicious actors to systematically generate adversarial disinformation for fact-checkers. In this work, we explore the sensitivity of automated fact-checkers to synthetic adversarial evidence in two simulated settings: AdversarialAddition, where we fabricate documents and add them to the evidence repository available to the fact-checking system, and AdversarialModification, where existing evidence source documents in the repository are automatically altered.

We report the absolute excess risk (AER) of mortality and excess mortality rate (EMR) from a nationally representative COVID-19 sentinel surveillance network including known COVID-19 risk factors in people aged 45 years and above. METHODS: Pseudonymised, coded clinical data were uploaded from contributing primary care providers (N=1,970,314, ≥45years). We calculated the AER in mortality by comparing mortality for weeks 2 to 20 this year with mortality data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) from 2018 for the same weeks. We conducted univariate and multivariate analysis including preselected variables. We report AER and EMR, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: The AER of mortality was 197•8/10,000 person years (95%CI:194•30-201•40) . The EMR for male gender, compared with female, was 1.4 (95%CI:1•35-1•44, p<0•00); for our oldest age band (≥75 years) 10•09 (95%CI:9•46-10•75, p<0•00) compared to 45-64 year olds; Black ethnicity's EMR was 1.17 (95%CI: 1•03-1•33, p<0•02), reference white; and for dwellings with ≥9 occupants 8•01 (95%CI: 9•46-10•75, p<0•00). Presence of all included comorbidities significantly increased EMR. Ranked from lowest to highest these were: hypertension, chronic kidney disease, chronic respiratory and heart disease, and cancer or immunocompromised.

The specific point of interest in this research is on predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare solutions. This point is supported by failures from the past, where the separate design of digital health solutions has led to lack of interoperability. Hence, this review paper investigates the integration of predictive, preventive and personalized interoperable digital healthcare systems. The second point of interest is the use of new mass surveillance technologies to feed personal data from health professionals to governments, without any comprehensive studies that determine if such new technologies and data policies would address the pandemic crisis. METHOD: This is a review paper. Two approaches were used: A comprehensive bibliographic review with R statistical methods of the COVID-19 pandemic in PubMed literature and Web of Science Core Collection, supported with Google Scholar search. In addition, a case study review of emerging new approaches in different regions, using medical literature, academic literature, news articles and other reliable data sources. RESULTS: Most countries’ digital responses involve big data analytics, integration of national health insurance databases, tracing travel history from individual’s location databases, code scanning and individual’s online reporting. Public responses of mistrust about privacy data misuse differ across countries, depending on the chosen public communication strategy. We propose predictive, preventive and personalized solutions for pandemic management, based on social machines and connected devices. SOLUTIONS: The proposed predictive, preventive and personalized solutions are based on the integration of IoT data, wearable device data, mobile apps data and individual data inputs from registered users, operating as a social machine with strong security and privacy protocols. We present solutions that would enable much greater speed in future responses. These solutions are enabled by the social aspect of human-computer interactions (social machines) and the increased connectivity of humans and devices (Internet of Things). CONCLUSION: Inadequate data for risk assessment on speed and urgency of COVID-19, combined with increased globalization of human society, led to the rapid spread of COVID-19. Despite an abundance of digital methods that could be used in slowing or stopping COVID-19 and future pandemics, the world remains unprepared, and lessons have not been learned from previous cases of pandemics.

However, few studies have investigated whether the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on psychological adjustment in youngest can be moderated by maternal mood and, to our knowledge, none of them has adopted a longitudinal design. The main aim of the current study was to explore if the intensity and directionality of maternal mood symptoms moderated the trajectory of emotional and behavioural problems in Italian pre-schoolers from pre- to during the lockdown adopting a longitudinal design. To assess maternal anxiety and depression symptoms, the EPDS and the STAI-Y were filled in by 94 and 88 women before the lockdown, when their children were 1 (Wave P1) and 3 years old (Wave P2), respectively, and by 74 women during the lockdown, when their children were 4 years old (Wave L). Mothers also filled in the CBCL/1 ½–5 to assess their children’s emotional and behavioural problems at each assessment wave. As a whole, children’s emotional and behavioural problems significantly increased from pre- to during the lockdown. Furthermore, maternal mood moderated this trajectory. In particular, greater maternal mood symptoms were significantly associated with a greater increase in emotional reactive, anxious-depressed, withdrawn and aggressive symptoms during the lockdown. These results contribute to shed light on the role played by maternal emotional wellbeing in buffering the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on children’s behavioural development. Albeit preliminary, the current findings highlight the need to provide timely psychological interventions to distressed mothers to help their children to better cope with the effects of the pandemic.

In particular, very preterm (VP) infants display anomalies in controlling attention and gathering task-relevant information. Early interventions that support attention control may be pivotal in providing a secure base for VP children’s later attainments. The Attention Control Training (ACT) is a cognitive training intervention that targets infants’ abilities to select visual information according to varying task demands but had not been tested in VP infants. We conducted a feasibility study to test the processes we intend to use in a trial delivering the ACT to VP infants. METHODS AND DESIGN: We tested recruitment and retention of VP infants and their families in a randomised trial, as well as acceptability and completion of baseline and outcome measures. To evaluate these aims, we used descriptive quantitative statistics and qualitative methods to analyse feedback from infants’ caregivers. We also investigated the quality of eye-tracking data collected and indicators of infants’ engagement in the training, using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Twelve VP infants were recruited, and 10 (83%) completed the study. Participants’ parents had high education attainment. The rate of completion of baseline and outcome measures was optimal. VP infants demonstrated engagement in the training, completing on average 84 min of training over three visits, and displaying improved performance during this training. Eye-tracking data quality was moderate, but this did not interfere with infants’ engagement in the training. DISCUSSION: The results suggest the ACT can be delivered to VP infants. However, challenges remain in recruitment of numerous and diverse samples. We discuss strategies to overcome these challenges informed by results of this study.

We evaluated the diagnosis and treatment of acute exacerbation (AE) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) under the tiered system. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study. COPD characteristics and treatments were compared among hospitals in different tiers. Associations were examined by univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis. In addition, multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the possible influencing factors of antibiotics, glucocorticoids and anticoagulant usages. RESULTS: Eligible COPD patients (n = 432) were consecutively recruited from eight hospitals in different tiers in China. Patients in the countryside preferred the community hospitals, whereas patients in cities preferred second-tier and teaching hospitals when they suffer from AECOPD. It indicates most COPD patients are likely to treat their disease locally. The severity of COPD AE increased with tiers of hospitals (p < 0.001). However, our results clearly show that most community hospitals can only deal with mild exacerbation of COPD. Approximately 90% of AE patients received antibiotics. We speculated that antibiotics abuse might exist in the three tiers of hospitals. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that long-term antibiotics usage (⩾14 days) was associated with moderate exacerbation [odds ratio (OR): 5.295, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 2.248–12.473, p < 0.001], radiographic progression (OR: 2.176, 95% CI: 1.047–4.522, p = 0.037), positive sputum etiology (OR: 3.073, 95% CI: 1.477–6.394, p = 0.003) and increased white blood cells (OR: 2.470, 95% CI: 1.190–5.126, p = 0.015). The proportion of glucocorticoids increased with the hospital hierarchy (18.6% versus 45.6% versus 69.2%, p < 0.001). The proportions of severe cases in the second-tier hospitals were 26.9%; however, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) rate was only 14.7%. Anticoagulant is not commonly used in AECOPD, and the community hospitals had the lowest proportion of anticoagulation regimen (1.7% versus 14.3% versus 20.5%, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The ‘tiered medical services’ policy in AECOPD management has been unsatisfactory in the past years. Irrational treatment strategies in different hospitals were still found when comparing with international guideline.

This systematic review aimed to investigate the efficacy of supplemental curcumin treatment on clinical outcomes and inflammation-related biomarker profiles in COVID-19 patients. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, ProQuest, and Ovid databases up to 30 June 2021 to find studies that assessed the effects of curcumin-related compounds in mild to severe COVID-19 patients. Six studies were identified which showed that curcumin supplementation led to a significant decrease in common symptoms, duration of hospitalization and deaths. In addition, all of these studies showed that the intervention led to amelioration of cytokine storm effects thought to be a driving force in severe COVID-19 cases. This was seen as a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in proinflammatory cytokines such as IL1β and IL6, with a concomitant significant (p < 0.05) increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-α. Taken together, these findings suggested that curcumin exerts its beneficial effects through at least partial restoration of pro-inflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance. In conclusion, curcumin supplementation may offer an efficacious and safe option for improving COVID-19 disease outcomes.

Expert opinion: The elderly population is at increased risk of developing and dying from COVID-19. Comorbidity is present in more than 30% of cases with COVID-19. Except for less than 1% of the total, a chronic condition has been found in all cases that died from COVID-19. Men are more than 1.5 times more likely to die from COVID-19.

As we enter the phase beyond limitations there is an urgent need for explicit treatment against COVID-19. To face this immediate global challenge, drug development from scratch is a lengthy process and unrealistic to conquer this battle. Drug repurposing is an emerging and practical approach where existing drugs, safe for humans, are redeployed to fight this harder to treat disease. A number of multi clinical studies have repurposed combined cocktail (remdesivir + chloroquine and favipiravir + chloroquine) to be effective against COVID-19. However, the exact mechanistic aspect has not yet been revealed. In the present study, we have tried to decipher the mechanistic aspects of existing medicines at the viral entry and replication stage via the structural viroinformatics approach. Here we implied the molecular docking and dynamic simulations with emphasis on the unique structural properties of host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), SARS-CoV2 spike protein and RNA dependent RNA polymerase enzyme (RdRp) of the SARS-CoV2. Deep structural analysis of target molecules exposed key binding residues and structural twists involved in binding with important pharmacophore features of existing drugs [(7-chloro-N-[5-(diethylamino)pentan-2-yl]quinolin-4-amine (chloroquine),N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide N-[[4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]methyl]-1,2-oxazole-5-carboxamide) (SSAA09E2), 2-ethylbutyl (2S)-2-{[(S)-{[(2R,3S,4R,5R)-5-{4-aminopyrrolo[2,1-f][1,2,4]triazin-7-yl}-5-cyano-3 (remdesivir) and 6-Fluor-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2-pyrazincarboxamid (favipiravir)]. It is evident from this structural informatics study that combo of chloroquine + SSAA09E2 with remdesivir or favipiravir could significantly restrain the virus at the entry and replication stage.

Family/friend caregivers often receive little to no education or training about dementia but are expected to provide ongoing support for a complex condition. Web-based family/friend caregiver interventions may be helpful, but little is known about how best to implement them. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to 1) design and develop a novel education prescription application to help scale and spread web-based dementia education to family/friend caregivers, 2) conduct user testing, and 3) conduct a larger-scale field trial. METHODS: A novel education prescription web-based application was designed and developed. Initial user testing used task completion and the “think aloud” technique with a small sample of representative clinicians who work with people living with dementia and family/friend caregivers. Following iterative incorporation of feedback, a larger field trial was conducted with a convenience sample of clinicians. Account invitations were sent to 55 clinicians and, following a 2-month trial period, surveys were administered to participants including the System Usability Scale and the Net Promoter Score. RESULTS: During the initial user testing phase, participants (N=7) from representative disciplines easily completed associated tasks, and had very positive feedback with respect to the usability of the application. The System Usability Scale score during this phase was 91.4. Suggestions from feedback were incorporated into the application. During the larger field trial phase, participants (total N=55; activated account n=17; did not activate account n=38) were given access to the iGeriCare education prescription application. During this period, 2 participants created educational prescriptions; a total of 3 educational prescriptions were sent. Survey completers who did not activate their account (n=5) identified that their lack of use was due to time constraints, competing priorities, or forgetting to use the application. Survey completers who activated their account (n=5) identified their lower use was due to lack of time, lack of eligible family/friend caregivers during trial period, and competing priorities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The System Usability Scale score during this phase was 78.75, and the Net Promoter Score was 50. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings indicate a generally positive response for the usability of a web-based application for clinicians to prescribe dementia education to family/friend caregivers. The dissonance between the promising data and widespread enthusiasm for the design and purpose of the education prescription application found in the initial user testing phase and subsequent lack of significant adoption in the field trial represents both an important lesson for other novel health technologies and a potential area for further investigation. Further research is required to better understand factors associated with implementation of this type of intervention and impact on dissemination of education to family/friend caregivers.",2020-12-04,"Levinson, Anthony J; Bousfield, John; Douglas, William; Ayers, Stephanie; Sztramko, Richard",JMIR Hum Factors,,,https://doi.org/10.2196/23904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33275103/,227280022.0,2020,455

Performing lung biopsies on hospitalized patients, however, has increased risk due to the patient’s underlying disease severity. Data evaluating the safety and efficacy of TBLC in hospitalized patients are limited. We present a comparison of TBLC for hospitalized and outpatients and provide the safety and diagnostic yields in these populations. METHODS: Demographic data, pulmonary function values, chest imaging pattern, procedural information, and diagnosis were recorded from enrolled patients. Complications from the procedure were the primary outcomes and diagnostic yield was the secondary outcome. RESULTS: 77 patients (n = 22 hospitalized vs n = 55 outpatient) underwent TBLC during the study period. Comparing adverse events between hospitalized and outpatients revealed no statistically significant differences in pneumothorax (9%, n = 2 vs 5%,n = 3), tube thoracostomy placement (5%, n = 1 vs 2%, n = 1), grade 2 bleeding (9%, n = 2 vs 0%, n = 0), escalation in level of care (5%, n = 1 vs 0%, n = 0), 30-day mortality (9%, n = 2 vs 2%, n = 1), and 60-day mortality (9%, n = 2 vs 4%, n = 2) (p > 0.05 for all). No deaths were attributed to the procedure. 95% of cases received a multidisciplinary conference diagnosis (hospitalized 100%, n = 22 vs outpatients 93%, n = 51, p = 0.32).

In addition to neurons, we emphasize the potential roles played by non-neuronal cells, as well as extracellular matrix in the hypothalamus in whole-body glucose homeostasis. Further, we review the ionic mechanisms by which glucose-sensing neurons sense fluctuations of ambient glucose levels.

Its modern practice is dominated by an industrial–productivist discourse, which has contributed to the simplification and degradation of human and ecological systems. As such, agricultural transformation is essential for creating more sustainable food systems. This paper focuses on discursive change. A prominent discursive alternative to industrial–productivist agriculture is regenerative agriculture. Regenerative discourses are emergent, radically evolving and diverse. It is unclear whether they have the potential to generate the changes required to shift industrial–productivist agriculture. This paper presents a literature-based discourse analysis to illustrate key thematic characteristics of regenerative agricultural discourses. The analysis finds that such discourses: situate agricultural work within nested, complex living systems; position farms as relational, characterised by co-evolution between humans and other landscape biota; perceive the innate potential of living systems as place-sourced; maintain a transformative openness to alternative thinking and practice; believe that multiple regenerative cultures are necessary for deeply regenerative agriculture; and depart from industrialism to varying degrees. The paper concludes by reviewing three transformative opportunities for regenerative discourses—discourse coalitions, translocal organising and collective learning.

METHOD: In a phase I randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial involving 192 healthy adults 18–59 years old, two injections of three doses (50 EU, 100 EU, 150 EU) of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine or placebo were administered intramuscularly at a 2- or 4-week interval. The safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine were evaluated. RESULTS: Vaccination was completed in 191 subjects. Forty-four adverse reactions occurred within 28 days, most commonly mild pain and redness at the injection site or slight fatigue.

Another challenge is to guarantee that an orchestration with correct input data terminates, and produces correct output data.

Results: Overall rate of oncologic patients from total was 2.7%. Among 916 COVID-19 admissions, 79 with cancer (8.6%;p< 0,001, hazard ratio 3.4). Mean age 69.1 (CI 68.1-70.1), 50% women (n=458) and 50% men (n=458). IHM 16.5% (n=13) in oncologic group and 11.2% (n=93) in non-oncologic patients (p=ns). Risk of death during hospitalization and follow-up (14 months) was significantly higher when presence of previous cancer (35.5%;n=28) than without cancer (24.35%;n=203), p=0.029. Mortality rate of cancer patients without COVID was 17.4% in the same period of follow up. Risk of death for oncologic patients was 3.8 higher if they had COVID (p< 0.001). Conclusions: COVID-19 hospitalization and death risk are significantly higher in patients with cancer, even with early strategies by the HC plan to reduce the risk. IHM wasn’t different from patients without cancer, but overall mortality was higher after discharge, comparing to cancer patients without COVID19. There is a crucial need to understand better and mitigate these excess hospitalization risks and higher mortality which may be revealed over the follow up.",2022-01-31,"Reis Neto, JP; Busch, J; Stefani, S",Value in Health,,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098301521030151; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301521030151; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2021.11.1220,246046500.0,2022,297

Adult Croatian citizens engaged in intimate relationships (N = 727) reported their relationship characteristics and assessed symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress during the state lockdown in May 2020. Three relationship profiles based on variations in key relationship characteristics were identified using latent profile analysis. Profiles represented distinct relationship types described as affectionate, ambivalent, and antagonistic relationships. These relationship types differed in their levels of love and perception of humility, responsiveness, and behavior of the partner. Relationship type was associated with mental health symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic and state lockdown. Being in an affectionate relationship was associated with the lowest levels of depression, anxiety, and stress, while in an antagonistic relationship these are in the highest levels. Ambivalent relationships were characterized by moderate levels on all measured mental health indicators with no difference in anxiety compared with affectionate relationships.

After the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been the focus of attention for scientists, governments and populations worldwide. In Brazil, the first case of COVID-19 was identified on February 26 2020, being the first country in Latin America to have affected patients. Almost four months later, more than one million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified in the country, and the virus has spread across all 27 states and is responsible for at least 48,954 deaths until June 19, 2020. In addition, a global outbreak requires the active participation of the nursing workforce in clinical care, education, and sharing of accurate information of public health and policies. This year is particularly important for Nursing, as 2020 is the international year for Nursing and Midwifery Professionals. Nursing professionals corresponds to more than half of the health workforce in the country, being crucial in implementing public health policies and programs. Nurses and frontline health care workers have a critical role in the COVID-19 prevention and response, not only by providing direct assistance to patients and communities, but also in the implementation of health promotion and prevention strategies.

Recent studies suggest that membrane proteins can directly interact with cholesterol owing to the presence of the cholesterol-recognizing amino-acid consensus (CRAC) motifs. One of the ways to verify and further develop this notion is a design of CRAC-containing peptides and investigation of their effects on cholesterol-dependent cell functions. Previously we showed that a newly constructed peptide RTKLWEMLVELGNMDKAVKLWRKLKR (peptide P4) containing two CRAC motifs modulates cholesterol-dependent interactions of cultured macrophages IC-21 with 2-μm particles. In this work, in order to clarify the role of CRAC-forming amino acids, we employed the same experimental system to test the activity of peptides closely related to P4 but with modified CRAC motifs. We found that peptide STKLSEMLSELGNMDKASKLSRKLSR (Mut2) analogous to P4, except that all CRAC-forming amino acids (V, W, K/R) were substituted by serine, did not produce any effect in the concentration range 0.5–50 μM corresponding to the range of the P4 activity. Neither was effective peptide RTKLSEMLVELGNMDKAVKLSRKLKR (Mut3), in which only aromatic amino acids (W) of the CRAC motifs were substituted. Peptide STKLWEMLVELGNMDKAVKLWRKLSR (Mut4), in which only cationic amino acids (R/K) in the CRAC motifs were changed, produced almost the same effect as that of peptide P4 with a bell-shape dose–response curve. At low concentrations (1–4 μM) Mut4 notably increased the number of beads per cell, at higher concentrations this parameter diminished, and at 50 μM Mut4 produced a robust toxic effect. Finally, peptide EWGMAVLWERNRKLKKDLKVLKMLRT (Mut1) composed of the same amino acid residues as P4 but in a random order (“scramble”) and possessing one CRAC motif, different from that in P4, produced a moderate stimulation at 4–10 μM but was not toxic at 50 μM. As in the case of peptide P4, the effects of Mut4 and Mut1 depended on the cholesterol content in the cell membrane: after the incubation of cells with cholesterol-extracting agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin stimulatory effects produced by Mut4 and Mut1 at low doses were suppressed. Our results indicate that CRAC motifs play an important role in the mechanisms of the peptide-induced modulations of cholesterol-dependent cell functions in the experimental system used and that of the three motif-forming amino acids, critical is the presence of the aromatic amino acid (W). Further research is required to comprehend the molecular mechanisms of interactions of CRAC-containing peptides with cell membrane components that lead to modulation of cell functions. We anticipate that CRAC-containing peptides may provide a basis for the development of new tools for directed regulation of the activity of target cholesterol-dependent membrane proteins and for the design of new antimicrobial and immunomodulating drugs in particular.",2020-12-02,"Dunina-Barkovskaya, A.

79r9yn4t,,PMC,Rehabilitation during a pandemic: psychiatrists as first responders?,10.1192/bjo.2021.484,PMC8770010,,cc-by,"AIMS: The South London and Maudsley High Support Rehabilitation Team supports a cohort of 120 long-term rehabilitation patients in the densely populated London borough of Southwark. COVID-19 has a high transmission rate and is more lethal amongst the elderly, ethnic minorities and those with comorbidities. For these reasons, COVID-19 poses a particular challenge to our patients. Most have significant comorbidities, live communally, engage infrequently with primary care and take high-risk medications like clozapine. Many are from black and minority ethnic backgrounds. During the Spring coronavirus wave, we found that unwell patients or their carers would contact our service for advice ahead of 111, primary care or emergency services. In response we designed a standard operating procedure to guide our response to possible cases. This aimed to ensure our advice and management for patients drew upon the latest emerging evidence. We audited our work and the burden of disease within our service until November 2020. METHOD: At a team level, we introduced same-day remote assessments structured around a standard operating procedure incorporating the latest primary care and national guidelines. At a trust level, treatment guidelines were amended permitting consultant discretion when deciding whether an urgent blood count was required for those unwell on clozapine, and routine blood count monitoring was extended to 3 months for eligible patients RESULT: By November 2020 we had only one confirmed case of COVID-19 on our caseload. This patient required ITU and recovered. Seven patients were judged ‘suspected’ to have suffered COVID-19 and eight were possible cases. One supported living accommodation had a possible outbreak. CONCLUSION: We are surprised to have had just one confirmed case of COVID-19, despite the vulnerability of our cohort. The attentiveness of our patients and their carers to government guidelines will have contributed to this figure. They have shown remarkable resilience. This pandemic has prompted trust-wide changes to clozapine monitoring and perhaps a permanently less intensive monitoring regime for some patients. That our patients contacted our team ahead of 111, primary care or emergency services may reflect the close trust they place in us to support them through difficulty. It is fitting for a service aiming to provide holistic care that our scope should have expanded in this way during the pandemic.

Data are also presented on aphid catches in suction traps at two heights and in light traps. Apart from colour sensitivity (yellow versus white) there was apparently a separate response to colour which in some species varied with season. Within yellow‐sensitive species there was also a differential response to colour. With the experimental methods used, it was not possible to define mathematically the active and passive landing components on cylindrical traps. Though the active landing component was large it varied between aphid species. Most species caught on horizontal traps at ground level had been flying above 1 m. In some species the response of males to colour and their landing behaviour differed from that of viviparae and oviparae. Four years data from suction traps suggest that aphid species can be divided into three categories on the basis of the height at which they normally fly. One group, mostly tree‐feeders, always show the greatest density at a high level (12.2 m) throughout the season. The second group always have the highest density at a low level (1 m) whilst a third group of species change at a specific date each autumn from a maximum density at 1–12.2 m.

Although nutrition support is acknowledged as an important intervention in TB programmes, it is seldom afforded commensurate priority for action. TB incidence and deaths worldwide are falling too slowly to meet WHO End TB Strategy milestones, and the number of undernourished people is increasing, likely to be further exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Undernutrition needs to be more urgently and intensively addressed. This is especially true for the WHO South-East Asia Region, where the high rates of undernutrition are a key driver of the TB epidemic. The evidence base has been sufficiently robust for clear and workable programmatic guidance to be formulated on assessment, counselling and interventions for TB patients. Many high-burden countries have developed policies addressing TB and nutrition. Gaps in research to date have frustrated the development of more refined programmatic approaches related to addressing TB and malnutrition. Future research can be shaped to inform targeted, actionable policies and programmes delivering dual benefits in terms of undernutrition and TB. There are clear opportunities for policy-makers to amplify efforts to end TB by addressing undernutrition.",2022-01-01,"Darnton-Hill, I.; Mandal, P.

They include New Delhi metallo-ß-lactamase (NDM)-producing carbapenemase (50.4% of all species in Ontario). Antibiotic challenges for resistant bacteria in neonates pose challenges of unknown dosing and side effects. We report two antenatally diagnosed CP-CRE colonization scenarios with the NDM 1 gene. The case involves extreme preterm twins who had worsening respiratory distress at birth requiring ventilator support, with the first twin also having cardiovascular instability. They were screened for CP-CRE, and a polymyxin antibiotic commenced. In the delivery room, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and the follow-up clinic, in collaboration with the interdisciplinary group, contact precautions and isolation procedures were instituted. None of the infants exhibited infection with CP-CRE. Consolidating knowledge with regard to CP-CRE and modifying human behavior associated with its spread can mitigate potential negative consequences. This relates to now and later, when travel and prolific human to human contact resumes, from endemic countries, after the current COVID-19 pandemic. Standardized efforts to curb the acquisition of this infection would be judicious given the challenges of treatment and continued emerging antibiotic resistance. Simple infection control measures involving contact precautions, staff education and parental cohorting can be useful and cost-effective in preventing transmission. Attention to NICU specific measures, including screening of at-risk mothers (invitro fertilization conception) and their probands, careful handling of breastmilk, judicious antibiotic choice and duration of treatment, is warranted. What does this study add? CP-CRE is a nosocomial infection with increasing incidence globally, and a serious threat to public health, making it likely that these cases will present with greater frequency to the NICU team. Only a few similar cases have been reported in the neonatal literature. Current published guidelines provide a framework for general hospital management. Still, they are not specific to the NICU experience and the need to manage the parents’ exposure and the infants. This article provides a holistic framework for managing confirmed or suspected cases of CP-CRE from the antenatal care through the NICU and into the follow-up clinic targeted at preventing or containing the spread of CP-CRE.",2021-05-15,"Seesahai, Judy; Church, Paige Terrien; Asztalos, Elizabeth; Eng-Chong, Melanee; Arbus, Jo; Banihani, Rudaina",Children (Basel),,document_parses/pdf_json/15b4c6a86bebd7a31c310afdf98f3204190330f0.json,https://doi.org/10.3390/children8050399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063374/,235228331.0,2021,344

Evidence for studying the impact of these health behavior changes on our mental health is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of psychological distresses and assess their influence by the change in the composite lifestyle behaviors before the COVID-19 pandemic till 16 weeks after the lockdown release in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between October 10 and 31, 2020 by posting an online survey on social media platforms (WhatsApp and Twitter) to collect data on participants' sociodemographic, lifestyle behaviors, and mental health aspects using a validated Arabic version of the short-form version of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21). RESULTS: A total of 363 responded to the questionnaire. The mean age was 36.26 ± 8.54 years, and 238 (65.6%) were men. Depression, stress, and anxiety were reported in 37.5, 26.7, and 16.5% of the participants, respectively. Negative lifestyle behavioral changes were significantly associated with stress and anxiety (p < 0.05). Logistic regression revealed that financial distress and history of psychiatric illnesses were common significant factors for developing the psychological distresses. CONCLUSION: Throughout the post-lockdown stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, there was an evidence of psychological distresses among the adults.

There is currently no formal training to reduce stigma toward mental illness in medical students in their educational curriculums in Iran like most other low and middle income countries. Therefore, aiming to provide a practical and effective training package focused on reducing stigma toward patients with mental illness in medical students, the current study conducted, as an expert panel with Delphi method, based on a scoping review, to develop an education package to improve attitude of medical students toward patients with mental illness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We surveyed the available international databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, PsycINFO, Tripdatabase, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews as well as Persian databases including Iranmedex, SID, Irandoc and Magiran in February and March 2020. After an extensive review of related resources, 13 articles met our inclusion criteria. Then, we extracted the related data including type and duration of the interventions, sample size, mean and standard deviation of stigma scores before and after interventions. To develop the package among the included interventions, we asked 16 experts in psychology, psychiatry, and social medicine to rate the interventions based on a number of variables such as effectiveness, feasibility and applicability in a Delphi process. RESULTS: The selected intervention in Delphi method with consensus of experts included a set of four sequential interactive interventions: showing a movie and discussing it, psychiatric training including contact with people who affected psychiatric disorders, social communication with people who affected psychiatric disorders, and group discussion on defining stigma and personal experiences. CONCLUSION: In the present study, we recommend a set of interventions to reduce stigma toward patients with mental illness among medical students in the form of a package of combined, interactive and sequential interventions that have been previously been shown to be effective in reducing stigma related to mental illness. We expect that implementation of these interventions would reduce mental illness stigma in medical students; which needs further verification.",2022-03-14,"Rezvanifar, Farahnaz; Shariat, Seyed Vahid; Shalbafan, Mohammadreza; Salehian, Razieh; Rasoulian, Maryam",Front Psychiatry,,document_parses/pdf_json/70d624cf568e879bbb492d98e2977794240a8af5.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8964120/,,2022,340

However, it remains unknown to what extent progress has been achieved in the prevention of cancer in the proximal colon, distal colon, and rectum. METHODS We analyzed trends in CRC incidence (2000-2016) and mortality (2000-2018) in Germany by sex, age, and tumor location. RESULTS The age-standardized incidence of CRC declined by 22.4% (from 65.3 to 50.7 per 100 000) in men and by 25.5% (from 42.7 to 31.8 per 100 000) in women. CRC mortality declined by 35.8% (from 29.6 to 19.0 per 100 000) in men and by 40.5% (19.0 to 11.3 per 100 000) in women. Despite demographic changes, the annual numbers of CRC cases and deaths still decreased from about 60 400 to 58 300 and from around 28 700 to 24 200, respectively. The decline in incidence was greatest in groups aged ≥ 55 years. While the incidence of cancer in the distal colon and rectum decreased by 34.5% and 26.2%, respectively, in men and by 41.0% and 27.9% in women, the incidence of proximal colon cancer remained stable in men and decreased by only 7.0% in women.

In this regard, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) have shown great promise, exhibiting antibiotic properties through the targeting of cellular nucleic acids. We aimed to study the efficacy of PNA as an anti-tuberculosis agent. Since the efficacy of PNA is limited by its low penetration into the cell, we also investigated combinatorial treatments using permeabilizing drugs to improve PNA efficacy. Various concentrations of anti-inhA PNA, permeabilizing drugs, and their combinations were screened against extracellular and intracellular mycobacteria.0.625 to 5 μM anti-inhA PNA was observed to merely inhibit the growth of extracellular M. smegmatis, while low intracellular bacterial load was reduced by 2 or 2.5 log-fold when treated with 2.5 or 5 μM PNA, respectively. Anti-inhA PNA against M. tuberculosis H37Ra exhibited bactericidal properties at 2.5 and 5 μM and enabled a slight reduction in intracellular M. tuberculosis at concentrations from 2.5 to 20 μM. Of the permeabilizing drugs tested, ethambutol showed the most permeabilizing potential and ultimately potentiated anti-inhA PNA to the greatest extent, reducing its efficacious concentration to 1.25 μM against both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis. Furthermore, an enhanced clearance of 1.3 log-fold was observed for ethambutol-anti-inhA PNA combinations against intracellular M. tuberculosis. Thus, permeabilizing drug-PNA combinations indeed exhibit improved efficacies. We therefore propose that anti-inhA PNA could improve therapy even when applied in minute doses as an addition to the current anti-tuberculosis drug regimen. IMPORTANCE Peptide nucleic acids have great potential in therapeutics as anti-gene/anti-sense agents. However, their limited uptake in cells has curtailed their widespread application. Through this study, we explore a PNA-drug combinatorial strategy to improve the efficacy of PNAs and reduce their effective concentrations. This work also focuses on improving tuberculosis treatment, which is hindered by the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is observed that the antibacterial efficacy of anti-inhA PNA is enhanced when it is combined with permeabilizing drugs, particularly ethambutol. This indicates that the addition of even small concentrations of anti-inhA PNA to the current TB regimen could potentiate their therapeutic efficiency. We hypothesize that this system would also overcome isoniazid resistance, since the resistance mutations lie outside the designed anti-inhA PNA target site.",2022-02-16,"Cotta, Karishma Berta; Ghosh, Saptarshi; Mehra, Sarika",Microbiology spectrum,,document_parses/pdf_json/dd2e92d1f781763cf5330c54aaf265dae7c893c1.json,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.01262-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35171048/,246865182.0,2022,367

By theorizing COVID-19 as a public bad, I shed light on one of the great debates of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries regarding the relationship between the United States and liberal international order (LIO). Conceptualizing the pandemic as a public bad, I analyze its consequences for US hegemony. Unlike other international public bads and many of the most important public goods that make up the LIO, the COVID-19 public bad not only has some degree of rivalry but can be made partially excludable, transforming it into more of a club good. Domestically, I demonstrate how the failure to effectively manage the COVID-19 public bad has compromised America's ability to secure the health of its citizens and the domestic economy, the very foundations for its international leadership. These failures jeopardize US provision of other global public goods. Internationally, I show how the US has already used the crisis strategically to reinforce its opposition to free international movement while abandoning the primary international institution tasked with fighting the public bad, the World Health Organization (WHO). While the only area where the United States has exercised leadership is in the monetary sphere, I argue this feat is more consequential for maintaining hegemony.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with bile duct tumor thrombus (BDTT) portends a poorer prognosis and often precludes patients from potential liver resection.4-6 We herein report a case of laparoscopic hepatectomy and thrombectomy in a patient with HCC and BDTT. METHODS CT, ERCP, and POCS showed a 40-mm tumor located in the right lobe with BDTT. A five 12-mm trocar was inserted at the umbilicus for laparoscope, the epigastrium, both sides of the hypochondrium, and right lateral region. Moreover, a 5-mm trocar was inserted at left hypochondrium. After cholecystectomy, hepatoduodenal ligament was encircled using the tourniquet through 5-mm trocar site. The right portal vein was transected by stapler following transection of the right hepatic artery. After ICG staining (0.5 mg/body i.v.),7 hepatic parenchymal transection was performed using clamp-crashing technique. Moreover, CUSA also was used near Glissonian sheath. BDTT was removed from the right BD. Moreover, the cholangioscopy confirmed no BDTT remnants. The resection stump was then sutured. Finally, the right hepatic vein was divided with a stapler. A drainage tube was placed in the right subphrenic space. Operation time was 496 min, and blood loss was 91 ml. The patient was discharged without complications on postoperative day 11. Pathological diagnosis showed moderately differentiated HCC, tumor size 40 × 45 mm with negative surgical margins.

Cancer patients are more sensitive to infections. Patients with active cancer treatment should be considered for priority access to COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: We evaluated between February and May 2021. 114 patients with solid tumours who were actively been treated at the IORS and have received vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 virus. Demographic data, diagnosis, current therapy and co-morbidities were collected from patients’ records. Data about vaccination: first and second dose, type of the vaccine and side effects were collected by questionnaire approved by the Ethics Committee. Results: 114 patients received the vaccine, 89 (78%) female, 25 (22%) male. Patients’ mean age was 61.3 ± 13.5 years, youngest was 37.8, the oldest was 83.9 years old. 105 of them received both doses of the vaccine. 36 pts (31.6%) had one and 30 (26.3%) had 2 or more co-morbidities requiring active therapy. 58 patients (50.9%) had early disease, 56 (49.1%) had metastatic disease. 42 patients (36.8%) was receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy. Out of 114 vaccinated patients, 7 of them (6.1%) had previously COVID-19 infection. One patient had COVID-19 infection 5 days after receiving second dose of vaccine. 81 patients (71.1%) received vaccine made by Sinopharm company, followed by Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine (14 patients, 12.3%), Sputnik V (10 patients, 8.8%) and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine (9 patients, 7.9%). 85 of them (74.6%) didn’t have any side effects after receiving the vaccine. 13 patients (11.4%) had 2 or more symptoms. The most common side effect was pain at the injection site of the vaccine and it was present in 12 patients (10.5%). 10 patients (8.8%) reported chills and shivering. Fever was present in 9 patients (7.9%). Only two patients had allergic-like reactions that was present with skin rush. None of the patients had severe allergic reactions.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: An urban acute general hospital in London, UK, comprising of five sites and two emergency departments. The hospital provides tertiary level general acute care but is not an acute mental health services provider. There is an inpatient liaison psychiatry service. PARTICIPANTS: 358 131 patients attended the emergency departments of our acute general hospital during the study period. Of these, 14 871 patients attended with an acute mental health presentation. A further 14 947 patients attending with a physical illness were also noted to have a concurrent recorded mental health diagnosis. RESULTS: Large numbers of patients present to our acute general hospital with mental health illness even though the organisation does not provide mental health services other than inpatient liaison psychiatry. There was some variation in the numbers and patterns of presentations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient numbers reduced to a mean of 9.13 (SD 3.38) patients presenting per day during the first ‘lockdown’ compared with 10.75 (SD 1.96) patients per day in an earlier matched time period (t=3.80, p<0.01). Acute mental health presentations following the third lockdown increased to a mean of 13.84 a day. CONCLUSIONS: Large numbers of patients present to our acute general hospital with mental health illness. This suggests a need for appropriate resource, staffing and training to address the needs of these patients in a non-mental health provider organisation and subsequent appropriate transfer for timely treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdowns have resulted in variation in the numbers and patterns of patients presenting with acute mental health illness but these presentations are not new.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and NAb remain detectable and relatively stable 3–4 months PSO, whereas IgM antibody rapidly decay. Approximately 65% of patients have detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cell responses 3–4 months PSO. Our results thus provide critical evidence that IgG, NAb, and T cell responses persist in the majority of patients for at least 3–4 months after infection.",2021-02-09,"Jiang, Xiao-Lin; Wang, Guo-Lin; Zhao, Xiang-Na; Yan, Fei-Hu; Yao, Lin; Kou, Zeng-Qiang; Ji, Sheng-Xiang; Zhang, Xiao-Li; Li, Cun-Bao; Duan, Li-Jun; Li, Yan; Zhang, Yu-Wen; Duan, Qing; Wang, Tie-Cheng; Li, En-Tao; Wei, Xiao; Wang, Qing-Yang; Wang, Xue-Feng; Sun, Wei-Yang; Gao, Yu-Wei; Kang, Dian-Min; Zhang, Ji-Yan; Ma, Mai-Juan",Nat Commun,,document_parses/pdf_json/042776a66b3866191fd66e120a324694834f2df4.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33563974/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-21155-x,231865530.0,2021,146

Patients with severe asthma may have a greater risk of dying from COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and enzyme proteases, transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and furin are needed for the attachment and invasion of the virus into host cells. We determined whether their expression in the airways of severe asthma patients is increased. Method. We examined the microarray mRNA expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin in the sputum, bronchial brush and bronchial biopsies of participants in the European U-BIOPRED cohort. Results. ACE2 and furin sputum gene expression was significantly increased in severe non-smoking asthma compared to mild-moderate asthma and healthy volunteers. By contrast, TMPRSS2 expression in bronchial biopsy and bronchial brushings was increased in severe smoking and ex-smoking asthmatics, and so was furin expression in bronchial brushings. Several clinical parameters including male gender, oral steroid use and nasal polyps were positively associated with ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin expression levels. There was a higher expression of ACE2 and furin in the sputum neutrophilic molecular phenotype with inflammasome activation compared to the eosinophilic Type2-high or paucigranulocytic phenotypes. The enrichment score of the IL-13-Type2 gene signature was positively correlated with ACE2, TMPRSS2 and furin levels. Conclusion.

In contrast, infection of SJL/J mice results in acute encephalitis, virus persistence, and immune-mediated demyelination. These experiments examined the role of T-cell subsets in the in vivo immune response to Theiler's virus in resistant C57BL/10SNJ mice. Depletion of T-cell subsets with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed at CD3 (pan-T-cell marker), CD4(+) (class II-restricted) or CD8(+) (class I-restricted) T cells resulted in increased frequency of paralysis and death as a result of acute encephalitis. Neuropathologic studies 10 days after infection demonstrated prominent necrosis, primarily in the pyramidal layer of hippocampus and in the thalamus of mice depleted of T-cell subsets. In immunosuppressed and infected C57BL/10SNJ mice, analysis of spinal cord sections 35 days after infection demonstrated small demyelinated lesions relatively devoid of inflammatory cells even though virus antigen could be detected by immunocytochemistry. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are important in the resistance to infection with Theiler's virus in C57BL/10SNJ mice.

Thus, due to its rapid action, passive immunisation is often used to treat disease caused by infection and/or toxin exposure. However immunoglobulins may also be administered prior to exposure to infection and/or toxin, although they will not provide long-lasting protection as is seen with active immunisation (vaccination) in which an immunological memory is established by controlled exposure of the host to the pathogen in question. With multi-factorial infectious diseases in production animals, especially those that have proven hard to control by vaccination, the potential of passive immunisation remains big. This review highlights a number of examples on the use of passive immunisation for the control of infectious disease in the modern production of a range of animals, including pigs, cattle, sheep, goat, poultry and fish. Special emphasis is given on the enablement of passive immunisation strategies in these production systems through low cost and ease of use as well as on the sources, composition and purity of immunoglobulin preparations used and their benefits as compared to current measures, including vaccination (also comprising maternal vaccination), antibiotics and feed additives such as spray-dried plasma. It is concluded that provided highly efficient, relatively low-price immunoglobulin products are available, passive immunisation has a clear role in the modern animal production sector as a means of controlling infectious diseases, importantly with a very low risk of causing development of bacterial resistance, thus constituting a real and widely applicable alternative to antibiotics.",2016-04-26,"Hedegaard, Chris J.; Heegaard, Peter M.H.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,,document_parses/pdf_json/6175da18ca315727b067a3f1fb28da6601ff5295.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242716300642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27185263/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242716300642; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2016.04.007,27750953.0,2016,277

Comprehensive workups, including clinical characteristics, laboratory, electroencephalography, neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid findings, are needed to understand the mechanisms. METHODS: We evaluated 32 consecutive critically ill patients with COVID-19 treated at a tertiary care center from March 9 to April 3, 2020, for concomitant severe central nervous system involvement. Patients identified underwent computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and autopsy in case of death. RESULTS: Of 32 critically ill patients with COVID-19, 8 (25%) had severe central nervous system involvement. Two presented with lacunar ischemic stroke in the early phase and 6 with prolonged impaired consciousness after termination of analgosedation. In all but one with delayed wake-up, neuroimaging or autopsy showed multiple cerebral microbleeds, in 3 with additional subarachnoid hemorrhage and in 2 with additional small ischemic lesions. In 3 patients, intracranial vessel wall sequence magnetic resonance imaging was performed for the first time to our knowledge. All showed contrast enhancement of vessel walls in large cerebral arteries, suggesting vascular wall pathologies with an inflammatory component. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions for SARS-CoV-2 in cerebrospinal fluid were all negative. No intrathecal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG synthesis was detectable.

METHODS: Eligible patients (aged 18 years or older) had a confirmed diagnosis of CD or UC and were willing and able to participate in telephone interviews. The survey design is based on a prior literature review, a pilot study, and clinical expert discussions. Preferences related to clinical and practical features of advanced therapies, like tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors, anti-integrins, anti-interleukins, and Janus kinase inhibitors, were assessed. Patients were asked to choose between two different hypothetical treatment alternatives visualized in up to 11 choice scenarios. Based on these choices, the relative importance of treatment characteristics was derived from regression coefficients estimated by a conditional logit model. RESULTS: Of the 291 patients included, 219 (75%) were eligible for this analysis. Among the evaluated attributes in CD, 1-year remission rate was ranked highest, with 42.3% relevance for the overall decision. The second most important attribute was the frequency of serious adverse events (AE) (25.1%), followed by sustained remission over 2 years (17.8%). Lower importance was assigned to the administration mode (14.6%) and none to the frequency of non-serious AE (0.1%). In UC, preferences were driven by efficacy (25.3% for mucosal healing; 23.4% for corticosteroid-free remission) and the frequency of serious AE (18.3%), followed by the administration mode (18.1%). Also, non-serious AE were classified as relevant factors for decision-making (10.7%), while maintaining remission for at least 2 years showed no significant impact (4.4%). CONCLUSION: For both indications, efficacy outcomes were rated most important, followed by the frequency of serious AE. Variations were mainly found in the evaluation of non-serious AE and sustained remission. Considering patient preferences may improve the effectiveness of available therapies for moderate to severe CD and UC.

Inferior colliculus (IC) neuronal responses adapt to the most frequent sound level within an acoustic scene (adaptation to stimulus statistics), a mechanism that may preserve neuronal and behavioral thresholds for signal detection. However, it is still unclear if the presence of foreground stimuli and/or task involvement can modify neuronal adaptation. To investigate how task-engagement interacts with this mechanism, we compared the response of IC neurons to background noise, which caused adaptation to stimulus statistics, while macaque monkeys performed a masked tone detection task (task-driven condition) with responses recorded when the same background noise was presented alone (passive listening condition). In the task-dependent condition, monkeys performed a Go/No-Go task while 50 ms tones were embedded within an adaptation-inducing continuous background noise, whose level changed every 50 ms and were drawn from a probability distribution. The adaptation to noise stimulus statistics in IC neuronal responses was significantly enhanced in the task-driven condition compared to the passive listening condition, showing that foreground stimuli and/or task-engagement can modify IC neuronal responses. Additionally, the response of IC neurons to noise was significantly affected by the preceding sensory information (history effect) regardless of task involvement.

METHODS An observational study on antibody response to a mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty) was performed on health care workers (V, n=120). Recovered COVID-19 patients (N, n=94) were used for comparison. Antibody response was evaluated by a quantitative anti-receptor binding domain IgG (anti-RBD) commercial assay and by virus microneutralization test (MNT), in order to establish a threshold of anti-RBD binding antibody units (BAU) able to predict a robust (≥1:80) MNT titer. RESULTS Significant correlation between BAU and MNT titers was found in both V and N, being stronger in V (rs=0.91 and 0.57 respectively, p<0.001); a higher incremental trend starting from MNT titer 1:80 was observed in the V group. The 99% probability of high MNT titer (≥1:80) was reached at 1,814 and 3,564 BAU/mL, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.99 (CI: 0.99-1.00) and 0.78 (CI: 0.67-0.86) in V and N, respectively.

METHODS: The study was based in UK primary healthcare. The mixed-methods design included rapid review, Delphi panel, interviews, focus groups and software development. Participants were 112 primary care clinicians and 50 patients recovered from COVID-19, recruited through social media, patient groups and snowballing. Using rapid literature review, we identified signs and symptoms which are commoner in severe COVID-19. Building a preliminary set of items from these, we ran four rounds of an online Delphi panel with 72 clinicians, the last incorporating fictional vignettes, collating data on R software. We refined the items iteratively in response to quantitative and qualitative feedback. Items in the penultimate round were checked against narrative interviews with 50 COVID-19 patients. We required, for each item, at least 80% clinician agreement on relevance, wording and cut-off values, and that the item addressed issues and concerns raised by patients. In focus groups, 40 clinicians suggested further refinements and discussed workability of the instrument in relation to local resources and care pathways. This informed design of an electronic template for primary care systems. RESULTS: The prevalidation RECAP-V0 comprises a red flag alert box and 10 assessment items: pulse, shortness of breath or respiratory rate, trajectory of breathlessness, pulse oximeter reading (with brief exercise test if appropriate) or symptoms suggestive of hypoxia, temperature or fever symptoms, duration of symptoms, muscle aches, new confusion, shielded list and known risk factors for poor outcome. It is not yet known how sensitive or specific it is. CONCLUSIONS: Items on RECAP-V0 align strongly with published evidence, clinical judgement and patient experience.

This study aimed to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs providing gastroenterological services. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy-four HCWs at the gastroenterological service of Al-Manial University Hospital, the main hospital of the largest tertiary university hospitals complex in Egypt (Kasr Al-Ainy Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University) were tested using real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal samples, and rapid serological IgM/IgG tests (RST). A questionnaire was used to collect demographic, occupational and clinical data. RESULTS: Of the 74 HCWs, 10 tested positive by RT-PCR (13.5%). In 9/74 (12.2 %) HCWs, antibodies could be detected by RST: three with both IgM and IgG lines; six with IgM line only and none with IgG line only. Frequency of positive tests was more among subjects with minor symptoms compared to completely asymptomatic HCWs (50% vs 16.1%, respectively). Neither age, gender or occupation was a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Point prevalence of COVID-19 in gastroenterology HCWs is 13.5% by RT-PCR.

Whether they are triggered by signals emitted by productively infected cells of the respiratory tract or are, at least partially, resulting from physical interaction with virus particles, remains unclear. Here, we analyzed susceptibility and expression profiles of PBMCs from healthy donors upon ex vivo exposure to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. In line with the absence of detectable ACE2 receptor expression, human PBMCs were refractory to productive infection. Bulk and single cell RNA-sequencing revealed JAK/STAT-dependent induction of interferon-stimulated genes, but not pro-inflammatory cytokines. This SARS-CoV-2-specific response was most pronounced in monocytes. SARS-CoV-2-RNA-positive monocytes displayed a lower ISG signature as compared to bystander cells of the identical culture. This suggests a preferential invasion of cells with a low ISG base-line profile or delivery of a SARS-CoV-2-specific sensing antagonist upon efficient particle internalization.

In primary care, they are underdiagnosed, partly because pediatricians often lack relevant training. We developed a brief, video-based training program for pediatric residents aimed at improving early identification of anxiety disorders in primary care. METHODS: Video content was consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics Behavioral Health Competencies, as applied to the evaluation of anxiety disorders and guidance for discussing treatment options. This training can be delivered in two formats: videos (43 minutes) can be shown in a live, group-based format, or accessed via an online, asynchronous training. We tested this training program using both formats and developed surveys to evaluate knowledge about child anxiety, perceived evaluation skills, and satisfaction with the training. We also developed a video-based vignette to measure sensitivity to detecting disorders (how much the condition is interfering, diagnostic severity, and referral urgency). RESULTS: Pediatric residents from two residency programs completed the training and pre- and posttraining assessments to evaluate program efficacy. Residents’ knowledge and perceived evaluation skills increased posttraining, with large effect sizes. Residents also demonstrated increased sensitivity to detecting anxiety disorders on the vignette-based assessment and reported high levels of satisfaction. DISCUSSION: Our results suggested that residents participating in this training improved their evaluation skills and that residents found the training beneficial.

xcr6kyca,,Medline,How COVID-19 has impacted the role of pharmacists around the world.,10.7399/fh.11652,,33709893.0,unk,"All over the world pharmacists are standing up to the challenge of COVID- 19 and showing their commitment to the communities they serve. As the COVID-19 pandemic has tested global health systems to their limits, pharmacy professionals have shown themselves to be an integral part of them. Community pharmacists have supported government initiatives to control the pandemic and have ensured patients continued to receive their medicines. Hospital pharmacists have been moving beyond their specialties to help provide critical care to patients while dealing with ICU drug shortages. Pharmaceutical scientists have been involved in finding effective vaccines and identifying effective treatments. In short, the pharmacy profession has been demonstrating expertise, strength, courage and dedication to care at the highest level. The International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), which represents the pharmacy profession globally, has a mission to advance pharmacy worldwide by sharing best pharmacy practice and innovation with the world. In this article, it describes how pharmacy has stepped up during the COVID‑19 crisis by giving examples from several countries. It highlights, for example, how virtual practice became more prominent as face-to-face meetings became impossible, how pharmacists' scope of practice has been extended, and how pharmacy educators have embraced digital technologies to teach and assess students remotely. In particular, the article highlights pharmacists' involvement in the COVID-19 vaccination programmes in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. As a result of all this, FIP sees an exciting future for the profession. Health ministers and heads of state have been praising pharmacists for their service, and FIP wants governments to translate this recognition into support for expanded roles and scientific research. It continues to gather data and intelligence to support an expansion of pharmacy practice, education and pharmaceutical workforce that builds on the profession's scientific base. All these advances are supported by scientific studies about our specialty. Finally, FIP expresses its worries about equity of access to medicines during the pandemic, as younger, healthier people in rich countries are vaccinated before people at greater risk in poor countries. It insists it will continue to advocate on this topic as a core component of its global vision. In this article, we share with readers a snapshot of how our profession around the world has adapted to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and our thoughts on the how it is affecting the evolution of pharmacy practice.",2021-02-22,"Jordan, Dominique; Guiu-Segura, Josep M; Sousa-Pinto, Gonçalo; Wang, Lin-Nam",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,,,https://doi.org/10.7399/fh.11652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709893/,232208339.0,2021,395

Here, we investigated plasma neuronal-derived extracellular vesicle (nEV) cargo in patients along the Alzheimer’s continuum, focusing on cognitively normal controls (NCs) with high brain β-amyloid (Aβ) loads (Aβ+). METHODS: The study was based on the Sino Longitudinal Study on Cognitive Decline project. We enrolled 246 participants, including 156 NCs, 45 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, and 45 AD dementia (ADD) patients. Brain Aβ loads were determined using positron emission tomography. NCs were classified into 84 Aβ− NCs and 72 Aβ+ NCs. Baseline plasma nEVs were isolated by immunoprecipitation with an anti-CD171 antibody. After verification, their cargos, including Aβ, tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, and neurofilament light, were quantified using a single-molecule array. Concentrations of these cargos were compared among the groups, and their receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed. A subset of participants underwent follow-up cognitive assessment and magnetic resonance imaging. The relationships of nEV cargo levels with amyloid deposition, longitudinal changes in cognition, and brain regional volume were explored using correlation analysis. Additionally, 458 subjects in the project had previously undergone plasma Aβ quantification. RESULTS: Only nEV Aβ was included in the subsequent analysis. We focused on Aβ(42) in the current study. After normalization of nEVs, the levels of Aβ(42) were found to increase gradually across the cognitive continuum, with the lowest in the Aβ− NC group, an increase in the Aβ+ NC group, a further increase in the aMCI group, and the highest in the ADD group, contributing to their diagnoses (Aβ− NCs vs. Aβ+ NCs, area under the ROC curve values of 0.663; vs. aMCI, 0.857; vs. ADD, 0.957). Furthermore, nEV Aβ(42) was significantly correlated with amyloid deposition, as well as longitudinal changes in cognition and entorhinal volume. There were no differences in plasma Aβ levels among NCs, aMCI, and ADD individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest the potential use of plasma nEV Aβ(42) levels in diagnosing AD-induced cognitive impairment and Aβ+ NCs. This biomarker reflects cortical amyloid deposition and predicts cognitive decline and entorhinal atrophy.

Based on representative survey data the study examines the impact of the pandemic on the economic situation of families with children in Austria. We compared the situation of couples with dependent children and single parents before the start of the crisis (February 2020) with the situation in June 2020. The descriptive results indicate that a large proportion of families were already affected by the economic consequences of the pandemic three months after the onset of the Corona crisis. Pandemic-related changes in the employment situation of parents led to significant financial losses and rising shares of families with difficulties managing on their current household income (subjective poverty risk). Among the most strongly affected families were couples with more than two minor children and single parents. The analyses illustrate the direct and massive impact of the pandemic on families in Austria.

DESIGN Systematic review of studies that have considered impacts of vaccines in relation to baseline risks. Calculation of risk reduction and harms from published data in two random controlled trials and one population-based implementation study. Analysis of risk reductions in geographical areas with varying baseline risks. Comparison of results concerning COVID-19 vaccine and selected prior vaccines. SETTING Random controlled trials of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in multiple countries; population-based study using Pfizer vaccine in Israel. Counties with varying baseline risks in the United States; states with varying baseline risks in India. PARTICIPANTS 43,448 and 30,420 subjects in the random controlled trials; 1,198,236 subjects in the population-based study. INTERVENTIONS Multi-site random controlled trials of vaccine efficacy; population-based administration of vaccine with determination of effectiveness by comparison of vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Relative risk reduction (RRR), absolute risk reduction (ARR), number needed to be vaccinated to prevent one symptomatic infection (NNV), absolute risk of the intervention (ARI), and number needed to harm (NNH). RESULTS A systematic review of literature in medicine and public health showed very few reports regarding ARR, NNV, ARI, and NNH; use of these indicators to compare benefits versus harms; or analysis of these EBM indicators in the context of varying baseline risks. From data in the two random controlled trials and one population-based study, calculated ARR was approximately 1 percent (as compared to RRR of 50 to 95 percent), and NNV was in the range of 100 to 500. In comparisons of ARR and NNV versus ARI and NNH, benefits and harms were not markedly different. From a sensitivity analysis of ARR and NNV in population groups with varying baseline risks, the effectiveness of vaccines as measured by ARR and NNV was substantially higher in regions with high as compared to low baseline risks. The ARR for COVID-19 vaccines was somewhat smaller and the NNV somewhat larger than achieved by some vaccines to prevent influenza and smallpox. CONCLUSION The efficacy and effectiveness of major COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by RRR, are impressive. As measured by ARR and NNV, which take into account variation in baseline risks, the effectiveness of the vaccines is substantially higher in areas with higher baseline risks. This finding can contribute to educational efforts, informed consent procedures, and policy making about priorities for vaccine distribution, especially under conditions of access barriers linked to poverty and inequality. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC Major COVID-19 vaccines so far have shown impressive efficacy in random controlled trials and effectiveness in population-based studies. To determine efficacy and effectiveness, these studies have used relative risk reduction (RRR), which shows the difference in event rate between those receiving and not receiving a vaccine. Reports of efficacy and effectiveness have not yet clarified other key indicators from evidence-based medicine (EBM) that consider variations baseline risks. Such indicators include measures of benefits such as absolute risk reduction (ARR) and number needed to be vaccinated (NNV), as well as measures of harm such as absolute risk of the intervention (ARI) and number needed to harm (NNH). WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS For COVID-19 vaccines, calculated ARR is somewhat lower and NNV somewhat higher than for certain prior vaccines such as those for influenza and smallpox. Indicators of harm for COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by ARI and NNH, appear to be in the same order of magnitude as indicators of benefit such as ARR and NNV. The effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines, as measured by ARR and NNV, is substantially higher in geographical areas with high baseline risk, compared to areas with low baseline risk. These findings can assist in informed consent procedures, educational efforts, and priority setting in policies about distribution of vaccines, especially in the context of access barriers related to poverty and inequality.",2021-07-02,"Larkin, A.; Waitzkin, H.",,,,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.28.21259039v1?rss=1,235700623.0,2021,658

In this paper we close this gap by using projection-based Random Forests that allow to use various degrees of local context without changing the overall properties of the classifier (i.e. its capacity). Results on two PolSAR data sets - one airborne over a rural area, one space-borne over a dense urban area - show that local context indeed has substantial influence on the achieved accuracy by reducing label noise and resolving ambiguities.

Therefore, our primary aim was to compare the concentration of l‐lactate to the concentration of neutrophils in sputum and systemic markers of infection. Because it is difficult to differentiate viral and bacterial infection on the basis of clinical presentation in LRTI, our secondary aim was to evaluate if l‐ and d‐lactate may serve as markers of local inflammation as representatives of neutrophils and bacteria, respectively. METHODS: Patients with acute LRTI were prospectively recruited. Sputum samples were collected and analysed for neutrophil count, l‐lactate and d‐lactate. We had data on pathogens from sputum cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (atypical bacteria, virus) and C‐reactive protein (CRP) from blood. RESULTS: In 44 sputum samples from 32 patients, the median (interquartile range (IQR)) sputum neutrophil granulocyte count was 0.615 × 10(7) cells/mL (0.236–1.575). The sputum neutrophil granulocyte count was associated with sputum l‐lactate (p = 0.011) and CRP (p = 0.018), but not with d‐lactate (p = 0.177). There was a strong association between sputum d‐lactate and l‐lactate (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: As l‐lactate in sputum is closely correlated to sequestration of neutrophils in the lungs, l‐lactate is a marker for local inflammation in LRTI and a potential biomarker in clinical management of LRTI.

Designs: An interventional, single-arm, non-randomized clinical trial conducted in Egypt from April 15 to July 21, 2020. Settings: This was a multi-centre study conducted in 3 hospitals in Egypt. Participants: a total of 94 COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed patients using qRT-PCR were enrolled in the study. Intervention: All patients were administered with two plasma units (each unit is 200cc). The volume of donated plasma was 800cc. Main Outcome and Measures: Primary measure was the degree of clinical improvement among the COVID-19 patients who received CPT within seven days Results: A total of 94 patients were enrolled who received CPT either within seven days or after seven days of hospitalization. 82 were severely ill, 12 were critically ill. The average age remained 58 years (SD 15.1 years). Male were 69% and 49% patients got cured while 51% died with CFR 51%. 75% deaths were above 45years of age. The symptoms were dyspnoea (55%), fever (52%), cough (46%), and loss of taste and smell (21%), and cyanosis (15%). The most common co-morbidities among the <40 years remained Diabetes Mellitus (21%) and Asthma (14%). Among 40-60 years Hypertension (56%), Diabetes Mellitus (39%) and among >60 years age group Hypertension (57%) and Chronic Heart Disease (24%) were reported.

Conclusion and Relevance: Among patients with COVID-19 and severe or critical illness, the use of CPT along with routine standard therapy resulted in a statistically significant improvement when administered within seven days of hospital admission. However, plasma transfusion, irrespective of days to transfusion may not help treat critically ill patients.

Neutralizing antibody responses are the best available correlate of protection against re-infection. Recent studies estimated that the correlate of 50% protection from re-infection was 20% of the mean convalescent neutralizing antibody titre. METHODS: We collected sera from a cohort of 124 individuals with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections from Prince of Wales Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital, Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Queen Mary Hospitals of the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong, for periods up to 386 days after symptom onset and tested these for antibody to SARS-CoV-2 using 50% virus plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT(50)), surrogate neutralization tests and spike receptor binding domain (RBD) binding antibody. Patients were recruited from 21 January 2020 to 16 February 2021 and follow-up samples were collected until 9th March 2021. FINDINGS: Because the rate of antibody waning slows with time, we fitted lines of decay to 115 sera from 62 patients collected beyond 90 days after symptom onset and estimate that PRNT(50) antibody will remain detectable for around 1,717 days after symptom onset and that levels conferring 50% protection will be maintained for around 990 days post-symptom onset, in symptomatic patients. This would potentially be affected by emerging virus variants. PRNT titres wane faster in children. There was a high level of correlation between PRNT(50) antibody titers and the % of inhibition in surrogate virus neutralization tests. INTERPRETATION: The data suggest that symptomatic COVID-19 disease is followed by relatively long-lived protection from re-infection by antigenically similar viruses.

In this study, poult MSCs were isolated, characterized, and infected with TCoV after in vitro culture. The poult-derived MSCs showed fibroblast-like morphology and the ability to undergo differentiation into mesodermal-derived cells and to support virus replication. Infection with TCoV resulted in cytopathic effects and the loss of cell viability. TCoV antigens and new viral progeny were detected at high levels, as were transcripts of the pro-inflammatory factors INFγ, IL-6, and IL-8.

DATA SOURCE: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, by using the expressions: “community‐acquired pneumonia” AND “child” AND “etiology” OR “diagnosis” OR “severity” OR “antibiotic”. All articles retrieved had the title and the abstract read, when the papers reporting the latest evidence on each subject were identified and downloaded for complete reading. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the era of largely implemented bacterial conjugate vaccines and widespread use of amplification nucleic acid techniques, respiratory viruses have been identified as the most frequent causative agents of community‐acquired pneumonia in patients under 5 years. Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation ≤ 96%) and increased work of breathing are signs most associated with community‐acquired pneumonia. Wheezing detected on physical examination independently predicts viral infection and the negative predictive value (95% confidence interval) of normal chest X‐ray and serum procalcitonin < 0.25 ng/dL was 92% (77‐98%) and 93% (90‐99%), respectively. Inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation < 90% are predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization. Moderate/large pleural effusions and multilobar infiltrates are predictors of severe disease. Orally administered amoxicillin is the first line outpatient treatment, while ampicillin, aqueous penicillin G, or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options to treat inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct aspects of childhood community‐acquired pneumonia have changed during the last three decades.",2020-03-18,"Nascimento‐Carvalho, Cristiana M.",,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7154611/,,2020,254

Data about the complex social and spatial structure of interpersonal contacts in the ED will aid construction of biologically plausible transmission risk models that can guide cross infection control. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We sought to determine the number and duration of contacts among patients and staff in a large, busy ED. This prospective study was conducted between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2010. Two 12-hour shifts per week were randomly selected for study. The study was conducted in the ED of an urban hospital. There were 81 shifts in the planned random sample of 104 (78%) with usable contact data, during which there were 9183 patient encounters. Of these, 6062 (66%) were approached to participate, of which 4732 (78%) agreed. Over the course of the year, 88 staff members participated (84%). A radiofrequency identification (RFID) system was installed and the ED divided into 89 distinct zones structured so copresence of two individuals in any zone implied a very high probability of contact <1 meter apart in space. During study observation periods, patients and staff were given RFID tags to wear. Contact events were recorded. These were further broken down with respect to the nature of the contacts, i.e., patient with patient, patient with staff, and staff with staff. 293,171 contact events were recorded, with a median of 22 contact events and 9 contacts with distinct individuals per participant per shift. Staff-staff interactions were more numerous and longer than patient-patient or patient-staff interactions. CONCLUSIONS: We used RFID to quantify contacts between patients and staff in a busy ED. These results are useful for studies of the spread of infections.

L’objectif de cette étude est de décrire les caractéristiques clinicobiologiques, morphologiques et de suivi des manifestations rhumatologiques observées suite à une infection récente à SARS-CoV-2. Matériels et méthodes Cette étude est une série française ambispective, multicentrique, de patients présentant une infection à SARS-CoV-2, associée à la survenue de manifestations rhumatologiques. Elle provient des premiers résultats d’un registre national (étude du CRI) de patients atteints du SARS-CoV-2. Du 7 avril 2020 au 24 juin 2021, nous avons recueilli les données clinicobiologiques, morphologiques, et la prise en charge de ces manifestations. Résultats Cette étude comprend 15 patients ayant présenté une infection à SARS-CoV-2 avec haute suspicion clinique et cas contact confirmé (n =2), confirmée par PCR nasale (n =8), trachéale (n =2), test salivaire (n =1) ou sérologie (n =2). L’âge moyen est de 55,1 ans (19–72) ; 53,3 % des patients sont de sexe féminin. Les comorbidités principales sont une hypertension artérielle (40 %), un diabète de type 2 (20 %), une obésité (20 %). Aucun patient ne présente d’antécédent de rhumatisme inflammatoire chronique sous traitement de fond, maladie auto-immune ou déficit immunitaire. Deux patients présentent un antécédent de psoriasis dans l’enfance. Le délai moyen d’apparition des manifestations rhumatologiques est de 32,9 jours après les premiers symptômes d’infection à SARS-CoV-2 et de 23,9 jours après confirmation diagnostique : arthralgies (100 %), myalgies (47 %), au moins une synovite (86 %). L’atteinte est majoritairement bilatérale (67 %), asymétrique (54 %), poly- ou oligo-articulaire (73 %). Trois patients présentent des signes extra-articulaires évoquant une maladie inflammatoire systémique (syndrome néphrotique, engelures, syndrome de Raynaud, papules de Gottron, télangiectasies). Un syndrome inflammatoire biologique est présent chez 80 % des patients. Un patient présente une positivité du facteur rhumatoïde à taux significatif, alors que les anticorps anti-CCP ne sont présents chez aucun d’entre eux. Les anticorps antinucléaires sont positifs à taux significatif (seuil de 1/160) chez 20 % des patients. Les radiographies ne montrent pas d’atteinte structurale. Dix patients ont bénéficié d’une évaluation échographique : sept présentent au moins une synovite, dont quatre avec hyperhémie Doppler. Une seule ponction articulaire de genou a été réalisée, retrouvant un liquide inflammatoire à prédominance de polynucléaires neutrophiles, sans cristaux. Nous disposons de données de suivi pour 12 patients. Le délai de suivi moyen par rapport au j0 des symptômes de l’infection à SARS-CoV-2 est de 15 mois (8–18). L’évolution a été favorable sous AINS ou corticothérapie chez 6 patients, et après abstention thérapeutique chez 2 patients. Parmi les 12 patients suivis, 6 ont présenté une rechute articulaire. Quatre patients ont fait l’objet d’un traitement de fond : csDMARDS (méthotrexate n =1, sulfasalazine n =1), bDMARDS (infliximab n =1, adalimumab n =1). Conclusion Notre étude rapporte plusieurs cas de manifestations rhumatologiques inflammatoires, non érosives, après une infection à SARS-CoV-2, après un suivi moyen de 15 mois.

The left TPC is crucial for phonological decoding, i.e., for learning and retaining sound-letter mappings. Here, we tested the causal contribution of this area for reading with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and explored the response of the reading network using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 28 healthy adult readers overtly read simple and complex words and pseudowords during fMRI after effective or sham TMS over the left TPC. Behaviorally, effective stimulation slowed pseudoword reading. A multivariate pattern analysis showed a shift in activity patterns in the left IFC for pseudoword reading after effective relative to sham TMS. Furthermore, active TMS led to increased effective connectivity from the left vOTC to the left TPC, specifically for pseudoword processing. The observed changes in task-related activity and connectivity suggest compensatory reorganization in the reading network following TMS-induced disruption of the left TPC. Our findings provide first evidence for a causal role of the left TPC for overt pseudoword reading and emphasize the relevance of functional interactions in the healthy reading network for successful pseudoword processing.",2022-04-21,"Turker, S.; Kuhnke, P.; Schmid, F.

The present study analyses substance misuse and its social and personal consequences using a population-based internet survey in Spain. Materials and Methods: Screening for drug abuse (of alcohol, marijuana/hashish and psychostimulants) and its related risks and problems was performed using the Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble (CRAFFT) score. Socio-demographic factors, depressive, anxiety and stress symptoms as well as health habits were also evaluated. We used Linear regression methods to compare each variable’s individual contribution so as to determine which one best explains the results. Results: In this population-based study, 1224 people completed and returned the online survey. Of all participants, 57% reported consuming at least one substance based on the CRAFFT scale. While increasing age reduces the probability of personal and social consequences of consumption, people who smoke receive up to three times more (OR = 3.370) recommendations from family and friends to reduce their consumption. As for the type of substance, the consumption of marijuana increases the risk of forgetting (OR = 2.33) and the consumption of other psychostimulant substances almost triples the risk of consuming alone (OR = 2.965). Combining substances can increase the rate of driving a vehicle after consumption by 3.4 times. Conclusions: Although age, smoking and the type of substances used increase the risk of suffering from social and personal consequences of the use or abuse of substances, future studies are needed to determine the influence of new variables as a potential tool for treating and minimizing the adverse consequences of drug abuse.",2022-01-01,"Ballestar-Tarín, María Luisa; Ibáñez-del-Valle, Vanessa; Cauli, Omar; Navarro-Martínez, Rut",Medicina (Kaunas),,document_parses/pdf_json/6dde5883d9a76e33dc7283a97bdf4b4f4330ee22.json,https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina58010065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35056373/,245816202.0,2022,265

This paper draws the research on food and nutritional security, food fraud and associated economic ecosystem, and the disruptions due to COVID‐19 for socio‐economic inequality globally. It is concluded that the safety risks have pushed enforcement of measures to reduce food supplies, adversely impacting food availability. Also, COVID‐19 is likely to raise fleeting food security and nutritional concerns across the globe, which most likely resulted in the rise in poverty, food fraud, limiting food supply and access. Accelerated investments intended to develop more inclusive, sustainable, and resilient food systems will help shrink the effect of the pandemic and, hence, a way to control the foreseen food security crisis and economic growth.

METHODS In this prospective multicenter study from the TRISP registry, we assessed the association between WBC on admission and 3-month poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale 3-6), mortality and occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH; ECASS-II-criteria) in IVT-treated stroke patients. WBC was used as continuous and categorical variable distinguishing leukocytosis (WBC > 10 × 109/l) and leukopenia (WBC < 4 × 109/l). We calculated unadjusted/ adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (OR [95% CI]) with logistic regression models. In a subgroup, we analyzed the association of combined leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP > 10 mg/l) on outcomes. RESULTS Of 10,813 IVT-treated patients, 2527 had leukocytosis, 112 leukopenia and 8174 normal WBC. Increasing WBC (by 1 × 109/l) predicted poor outcome (ORadjusted 1.04[1.02-1.06]) but not mortality and sICH. Leukocytosis was independently associated with poor outcome (ORadjusted 1.48[1.29-1.69]) and mortality (ORadjusted 1.60[1.35-1.89]) but not with sICH (ORadjusted 1.17[0.94-1.45]). Leukopenia did not predict any outcome. In a subgroup, combined leukocytosis and elevated CRP had the strongest association with poor outcome (ORadjusted 2.26[1.76-2.91]) and mortality (ORadjusted 2.43[1.86-3.16]) when compared to combined normal WBC and CRP.

A host infected with the virus triggers a series of innate and adaptive immunity. The realization of innate immune responses involves the participation of a series of protein molecules in host cells, including receptors, signal molecules and antiviral molecules. Post-translational modification of cellular proteins by ubiquitin regulates numerous cellular processes, including innate immune responses. Ubiquitin-mediated control over these processes can be reversed by cellular or viral deubiquitinases (DUBs). DUBs have now been identified in diverse viral lineages, and their characterization is providing valuable insights into virus biology and the role of the ubiquitin system in host antiviral mechanisms. In this review, we briefly introduce the mechanisms of ubiquitination and deubiquitination, present antiviral innate immune response and its regulation by ubiquitin, and summarize the prevalence of DUBs encoded by viruses (Arteriviridae, Asfarviridae, Nairoviridae, Coronaviridae, Herpesviridae, and Picornaviridae) infecting domestic animals and poultry. It is found that these DUBs suppress the innate immune responses mainly by affecting the production of type I interferon (IFN), which causes immune evasion of the viruses and promotes their replication.

The aim of this work was to determine which past interventions to peer review and decision-making have worked to improve research funding practices, how they worked, and for whom. METHODS: Realist synthesis of peer-review publications and grey literature reporting interventions in peer review for research funding. RESULTS: We analysed 96 publications and 36 website sources. Sixty publications enabled us to extract stakeholder-specific context-mechanism-outcomes configurations (CMOCs) for 50 interventions, which formed the basis of our synthesis. Shorter applications, reviewer and applicant training, virtual funding panels, enhanced decision models, institutional submission quotas, applicant training in peer review and grant-writing reduced interrater variability, increased relevance of funded research, reduced time taken to write and review applications, promoted increased investment into innovation, and lowered cost of panels. CONCLUSIONS: Reports of 50 interventions in different areas of peer review provide useful guidance on ways of solving common issues with the peer review process. Evidence of the broader impact of these interventions on the research ecosystem is still needed, and future research should aim to identify processes that consistently work to improve peer review across funders and research contexts.

In order to investigate whether these genetic factors might influence susceptibility to infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐Cov) as well as the course and severity of the infection, we evaluated polymorphisms of FcγRIIA and MBL genes in DNA samples from a group of approximately 180 people from Hong Kong who were infected with SARS‐Cov. These included 132 patients who had moderate course of SARS infection (home subgroup), 26 patients with a severe course requiring treatment in an intensive care ward (ICU subgroup) and a subgroup of 22 patients who died from SARS (deceased subgroup). A total of 200 normal blood donors from the same region were used as controls. A significant association was found between the FcγRIIA‐R/R131 genotype and a severe course of SARS, with higher frequency of homozygosity for FcγRIIA‐R/R131 in the ICU subgroup of SARS patients when compared with controls (P = 0.03; odds ratio: 3.2; 95% confidence interval: 1.1–9.1). In comparison with controls, a significant difference in linear trend distribution of FcγRIIA genotypes was seen among the severe SARS patients (ICU and deceased subgroups) without co‐morbidity, and the incidence of FcγRIIA‐H/H131 was lower in these patients as well. There were no significant differences in MBL genotypes and allele frequencies among SARS patients and controls.

However, the format of delivering CBT in person limits access to the intervention. The advancements in information and communication technology, especially the internet, present an opportunity for cognitive behavioral therapists to service patients or clients in remote areas through videoconferencing. Although many randomized controlled trials of videoconference-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (VCBT) have already been conducted, the overall estimated effect size of VCBT for psychiatric disorders has not been examined by systematic reviews and meta-analyses. OBJECTIVE: This study attempts to evaluate the effectiveness of VCBT for psychiatric disorders through a systematic and meta-analytic review. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in which VCBT was directly compared to control groups (such as treatment as usual, attention control, wait-list control, and other minimal supports) was carried out. To identify previous studies that meet our study objective, 2 independent reviewers undertook a systematic search through seven databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Web of Science, Science Direct, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS, and SciELO. Other databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Central Resister of Controlled Trials) were also checked. All studies included in the review were assessed using the quality criteria of the Cochrane Collaboration. Statistical analysis was performed by using Cochrane Review Manager (RevMan, version 5.4.0). Standardized mean difference was used in major meta-analyses where a P value of .05 or less was the threshold for statistical significance. A heterogeneity test and the chi-square test were performed to assess the presence and extent of statistical heterogeneity with significance set at P<.10. Funnel plots were visually inspected to assess the risk of bias. Subgroup analyses were conducted for each disorder to estimate intervention effects. RESULTS: The systematic search resulted in 16 studies (total N=1745) that met the criteria for this study and were included in the review. There were 10 studies on depressive symptoms, 3 on chronic pain, 1 on generalized anxiety disorder, 1 on obsessive-compulsive disorder, and 1 on hypochondriasis. The quality and risk of bias was also assessed. Results showed a pooled effect size (Hedge g) post treatment of −0.49 (95% CI –0.68 to –0.29), indicating that VCBT is effective for clients with psychiatric disorders. Study quality did not affect outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: While the overall results indicate the effectiveness of VCBT, there are still only a limited number of studies on specific psychiatric and somatic conditions. Therefore, more randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the effectiveness of VCBT for different disorders.

The human estrogen receptor α contains a ligand binding domain that enforces dimerization and nuclear import upon binding of the inducer 17β-estradiol. In this study, we tested the potential of this ligand binding domain to be used in filamentous fungi as an auto-regulatory domain in a synthetic transcription factor. RESULTS: We constructed the synthetic transcription factor SynX by fusing the DNA-binding domain of Xyr1 (Xylanase Regulator 1), the transactivation domain of Ypr1 (Yellow Pigment Regulator 1), and the ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor α. SynX is able to strongly induce the gene expression of xylanases and an aldose reductase by addition of 17β-estradiol, but SynX does not induce gene expression of cellulases. Importantly, the induction of xylanase activities is mostly carbon source independent and can be fine-tuned by controlling the concentration of 17β-estradiol. CONCLUSION: The ability of SynX to induce gene expression of xylanase encoding genes by addition of 17β-estradiol demonstrates that the ligand binding domain of the human estrogen receptor α works in filamentous fungi, and that it can be combined with a transactivation domain other than the commonly used transactivation domain of herpes simplex virion protein VP16.",2020-08-03,"Derntl, Christian; Mach, Robert; Mach-Aigner, Astrid",Fungal Biol Biotechnol,,document_parses/pdf_json/4257b0b9b7c4fd45ea55ed81933f2166d8fbcb4c.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7396459/,,2020,224

Preclinical studies support the efficacy of expanded allogeneic adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (eASCs) in the treatment of sepsis. In this study, we aim to test the safety, tolerability and efficacy of eASCs as adjunctive therapy in patients with severe CABP (sCABP). METHODS: In addition to standard of care according to local guidelines, we will administer eASCs (Cx611) or placebo intravenously as adjunctive therapy to patients with sCABP. Enrolment is planned for approximately 180 patients who will be randomised to treatment groups in a 1:1 ratio according to a pre-defined randomization list. An equal number of patients is planned for allocation to each group. Cx611 will be administered on Day 1 and on Day 3 at a dose of 160 million cells (2 million cells / mL, total volume 80 mL) through a 20–30 min (240 mL/hr) intravenous (IV) central line infusion after dilution with Ringer Lactate solution. Placebo (Ringer Lactate) will also be administered through a 20–30 min (240 mL/hr) IV central line infusion at the same quantity (total volume of 80 mL) and following the same schedule as the active treatment. The study was initiated in January 2017 and approved by competent authorities and ethics committees in Belgium, Spain, Lithuania, Italy, Norway and France; monitoring will be performed at regular intervals. Funding is from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program. DISCUSSION: SEPCELL is the first trial to assess the effects of eASCs in sCABP. The data generated will advance understanding of the mode of action of Cx611 and will provide evidence on the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Cx611 in patients with sCABP. These data will be critical for the design of future confirmatory clinical investigations and will assist in defining endpoints, key biomarkers of interest and sample size determination.

This systematic review explores the associations between preoperative frailty and perioperative complications in benign gynecologic surgery. METHODS A comprehensive, systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed interface for Medline, Embase, and Scopus databases through August 12, 2020. Articles were included if they described the utilization of frailty assessment tools in benign gynecologic patients in the pre- or perioperative setting. Study quality and evidence were evaluated by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool in Non-Randomized Studies and Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development, and Evaluations criteria. RESULTS One thousand one hundred twenty unique citations were identified, and five studies assessing frailty and perioperative outcomes were included. Three retrospective cohort studies utilized the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database to assess the impact of frailty on perioperative outcomes in hysterectomies and pelvic organ prolapse repair procedures. One retrospective cohort study utilized a California database to assess frailty in prolapse repair surgeries. One cross-sectional study assessed frailty in new urogynecology patient visits. Four of these studies found that preoperative frailty is associated with an increased risk of perioperative complications. Overall, the evidence from the included studies is of low quality and at moderate to critical risk of bias.

Here we used the peptide COVID-2019-HR1P1 (40 amino acids) as the target, which was derived from HR1 of SARA-CoV-2 spike protein, while the designed peptides including COVID-2019-HR2P1 (37 amino acids), COVID-2019-HR2P2 (32 amino acids) and others derived from HR2 of SARA-CoV-2 were tested for their binding to COVID-2019-HR1P1. Interestingly, results showed that both COVID-2019-HR2P1 and COVID-2019-HR2P2 can form the complex with COVID-2019-HR1P1, respectively.

To date, few drugs are licensed for the treatment of HCMV infections, most of which target the viral DNA polymerase and suffer from many drawbacks, including long-term toxicity, low potency, and poor bioavailability. In addition, the emergence of drug-resistant viral strains is becoming an increasing problem for disease management. Finally, none of the current anti-HCMV drugs have been approved for the treatment of congenital infections. For all these reasons, there is still a strong need for new anti-HCMV drugs with novel mechanisms of action. The first events of the virus replication cycle, including attachment, entry, immediate-early gene expression, and immediate-early functions—in particular that of Immediate-Early 2 protein—represent attractive targets for the development of novel antiviral compounds. Such inhibitors would block not only the expression of viral immediate-early proteins, which play a key role in the pathogenesis of HCMV infection, but also the host immunomodulation and the changes to cell physiology induced by the first events of virus infection.

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), especially bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, have adverse effects on human health. However, the association of BPA and phthalates with breast cancer remains conflicting. This study aims to investigate the association of BPA and phthalates with breast cancer. Methods: Correlative studies were identified by systematically searching three electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Web of Sciences, and Embase, up to November 2020. All data were analyzed using Stata 15.0. Results: A total of nine studies, consisting of 7820 breast cancer cases and controls, were included. The urinary phthalate metabolite mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) and mono-2-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) were negatively associated with breast cancer (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60–0.90; OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.58–0.98, respectively). However, the overall ORs for BPA, mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), and mono-butyl phthalate (MBP) were 0.85 (95% CI: 0.69–1.05), 0.96 (95% CI: 0.62–1.48), 1.12 (95% CI: 0.88–1.42), 1.13 (95% CI: 0.74–1.73), 1.01 (95% CI: 0.74–1.40), 0.74 (95% CI: 0.48–1.14), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55–1.15), respectively, suggesting no significant association. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were relatively stable. Conclusion: Phthalate metabolites MBzP and MiBP were passively associated with breast cancer, whereas no associations were found between BPA, MEP, MEHHP, MEHP, MEOHP, MCPP, and MBP and breast cancer.

We analyzed clinical data of 2017 COVID-19 cases reported in the Dubai health authority and developed predictive models to predict the patient's length of hospital stay and risk of death. A decision tree (DT) model to predict COVID-19 length of stay was developed based on patient clinical information. The model showed very good performance with a coefficient of determination R(2) of 49.8% and a median absolute deviation of 2.85 days. Furthermore, another DT-based model was constructed to predict COVID-19 risk of death. The model showed excellent performance with sensitivity and specificity of 96.5 and 87.8%, respectively, and overall prediction accuracy of 96%. Further validation using unsupervised learning methods showed similar separation patterns, and a receiver operator characteristic approach suggested stable and robust DT model performance. The results show that a high risk of death of 78.2% is indicated for intubated COVID-19 patients who have not used anticoagulant medications. Fortunately, intubated patients who are using anticoagulant and dexamethasone medications with an international normalized ratio of <1.69 have zero risk of death from COVID-19.

Of 1,255 people who clicked on the survey link, 862 responded; of these, 539 responses were eligible for analysis. Results: Respondents reported providing a wide range of support that went beyond health information, food and medical prescription assistance, to include raising morale through humour, creativity and acts of kindness and solidarity. A substantial proportion felt that they had become more involved in neighbourhood life following the lockdown and had an interest in becoming more involved in future. Neighbour support spanned all adult age groups, including older people categorised as being at-risk to the virus. With respect to most measures, there were no differences in the characteristics of support between respondents in areas of higher and lower deprivation. However, respondents from more deprived areas were more likely to state that they were involved in supporting certain vulnerable groups.

Traditionally, this ecology theory based outlook focuses on the risks of mortality, treating the make-up of an organization’s architecture as uniform and thus relatively inconsequential for understanding this hazard. Renewing recent debates on inertia and on structure, in this paper we examine the specifics of the make-up of structural inertia in the context of failure hazards—the measurable survival risks associated with failure. Developing a classification of structural inertia, we test a sample of 755 firms listed on the Taiwanese Security Exchange across 52 industries to develop a convention on organizational structure, ratifying that structural inertia differs by type in incorporating failure hazards. Findings differentiate between and elaborate the validating environmental and resource conditions for these different categories, detailing the extent to which failure hazards are related to the specifics of each type. This variation is helpful in explaining better why, despite conditions leading to failure, inert organizations continue to thrive over time. Discussing this logic addresses the narrow representation of structural inertia and limitations to its theoretical development over several decades. It also shows that traditional organizational ecology measures can be legitimately underplayed in organizations dealing with increased failure hazards in favor of the characteristics of different structural inertia types.",2018-06-28,"Schwarz, Gavin M.; Yang, Kuo-Pin; Chou, Christine; Chiu, Yu-Jen",Asia Pac J Manag,,document_parses/pdf_json/18218dc3e7be35bc45fea407a01556c19d0b6c53.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223889/,,2018,227

NPLI has also undergone International Peer Reviews through Asia Pacific Metrology Programme (APMP) to register 236 Calibration and Measurement Capabilities (CMCs) on various parameters in International Bureau of Weights and Measures Key Comparison Database (BIPM KCDB). However, NPLI for the first time implemented uniform quality system based on ISO 17034 in 2020. In this direction, NPLI for the first time prepared integrated Quality Manual to make policies, objectives and procedures addressing all the requirements of both the standards. Presently, 28 Sub-Divisions of NPLI follow quality system. Some of the Sub-Divisions are involved only in calibration/testing activities maintain only ISO/IEC 17025: 2017. Similarly, some of the Sub-Divisions are involved only in development/production of RMs/certified reference materials (CRMs) (Bharatiya Nirdeshak Dravya, BND(®)–Indian Reference Material) maintain only ISO 17034. On the other hand, few Sub-Divisions are involved both in calibration/testing as well as BND activities and accordingly follow both the standards. It is an extraordinary challenge for implementation and monitoring of quality system in such a big organization like NPLI. In this article, authors have highlighted preparation process of integrated quality manual based on ISO/IEC 17025: 2017 and ISO 17034: 2016 including policies, objectives & procedures adopted and its implementation process at NPLI. In November, 2020, NPLI has undergone on-site peer review of quality system of 23 Sub-Divisions through APMP.",2021-07-24,"Mandal, Goutam; Ansari, M. A.; Aswal, D.

We systematically investigated the impact of PAF units in a mock classroom, as a supplement to background ventilation, on localized and whole-room surface deposition and particle concentration. Fluorescently tagged particles with a volumetric mean diameter near 2 μm were continuously introduced into the classroom environment via a breathing simulator with a prescribed inhalation–exhalation waveform. Deposition velocities were inferred on >50 horizontal and vertical surfaces throughout the classroom, while aerosol concentrations were spatially monitored via optical particle spectrometry. Results revealed a particle decay rate consistent with expectations based upon the reported clean air delivery rates of the PAF units. Additionally, the PAF units reduced peak concentrations by a factor of around 2.5 compared to the highest concentrations observed and led to a statistically significant reduction in deposition velocities for horizontal surfaces >2.5 m from the aerosol source. Our results not only confirm that PAF units can reduce particle concentrations but also demonstrate that they may lead to reduced particle deposition throughout an indoor environment when properly positioned with respect to the location of the particle source(s) within the room (e.g., where the largest group of students sit) and the predominant air distribution profile of the room.",2022-02-17,"Kong, Meng; Li, Linhao; Eilts, Stephanie M.; Li, Li; Hogan, Christopher J.; Pope, Zachary C.",ACS ES T Eng,,document_parses/pdf_json/e1e79b9ea861f998c835b636a1d5f212d75a8959.json; document_parses/pdf_json/f3f66a15f3583cc9b8ea2c28323146ff943027de.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8864773/,,2022,240

Sensitive and quantitative detection of human enteric viruses is typically achieved through quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). A nanofluidic real-time PCR system was used to develop novel high-throughput methods for qualitative molecular detection (RT-qPCR array) and quantification of human pathogenic viruses by digital RT-PCR (RT-dPCR). The performance of high-throughput PCR methods was investigated for detecting 19 human pathogenic viruses and two main process controls used in food virology. The conventional real-time PCR system was compared to the RT-dPCR and RT-qPCR array. Based on the number of genome copies calculated by spectrophotometry, sensitivity was found to be slightly better with RT-qPCR than with RT-dPCR for 14 viruses by a factor range of from 0.3 to 1.6 log(10). Conversely, sensitivity was better with RT-dPCR than with RT-qPCR for seven viruses by a factor range of from 0.10 to 1.40 log(10). Interestingly, the number of genome copies determined by RT-dPCR was always from 1 to 2 log(10) lower than the expected copy number calculated by RT-qPCR standard curve. The sensitivity of the RT-qPCR and RT-qPCR array assays was found to be similar for two viruses, and better with RT-qPCR than with RT-qPCR array for eighteen viruses by a factor range of from 0.7 to 3.0 log(10). Conversely, sensitivity was only 0.30 log(10) better with the RT-qPCR array than with conventional RT-qPCR assays for norovirus GIV detection. Finally, the RT-qPCR array and RT-dPCR assays were successfully used together to screen clinical samples and quantify pathogenic viruses. Additionally, this method made it possible to identify co-infection in clinical samples. In conclusion, given the rapidity and potential for large numbers of viral targets, this nanofluidic RT-qPCR assay should have a major impact on human pathogenic virus surveillance and outbreak investigations and is likely to be of benefit to public health.",2016-01-29,"Coudray-Meunier, Coralie; Fraisse, Audrey; Martin-Latil, Sandra; Delannoy, Sabine; Fach, Patrick; Perelle, Sylvie",PLoS One,,document_parses/pdf_json/10a9a18d6d821b917178be32b20f98c9e21d6028.json,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0147832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26824897/,16095271.0,2016,307

We cloned 58 lipoproteins from A. pleuropneumoniae JL03 (serovar 3) and expressed them in Escherichia coli. Five proteins with strong positive signals in western blotting analysis were used to immunize mice. These proteins elicited significant antibody responses, and three of them (APJL_0922, APJL_1380 and APJL_1976) generated efficient immunoprotection in mice against lethal heterologous challenge with A. pleuropneumoniae 4074 (serovar 1), both in the active and passive immunization assays.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the exposure, impact and experience of the pandemic on families of pediatric solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients compared to families of healthy children and adolescents. METHODS: We recruited 96 families, 48 with a pediatric SOT recipient and 48 healthy controls, matched by child age and gender. A primary caregiver from each family responded to an online sociodemographic questionnaire and the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey (CEFIS), which explores the exposure, impact and experience of the pandemic and lockdown on families. RESULTS: Exposure to the pandemic was greater in families of healthy children and adolescents. The impact was mostly negative in both groups: caregivers reported increased anxiety (76%) and mood disturbances (71.9%) and hindered quality of sleep (64.6%) and health habits (58.3%). On the positive side, family relationships improved. Qualitatively, the SOT group positively perceived isolation and established hygienic measures as protective and destigmatizing, although they reported fear of virus transmission to their child. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological impact of the pandemic has been similar in both groups, although families of transplant recipients have protected themselves more, probably because they are used to prevention measures and they see contagion as a graver risk.

Children are one of the most susceptible groups for severe influenza. Clinical differentiation between viral and bacterial pneumonia is difficult to assess in children, so the aid of the complete blood count (CBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are used to differentiate between them. However, differential diagnosis between influenza-positive and -negative viral pneumonia is difficult. CRP levels have been found to be higher in H1N1 influenza adult patients. However, there are no studies regarding CBC, and CRP levels in pediatric patients with influenza-positive and -negative pneumonia. METHODS: From 2011 to 2016, we found children less than 18 years old with viral pneumonia who had positive viral RT–PCR test for adenovirus, bocavirus, influenza, parainfluenza, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Means for white blood cells (WBC), neutrophils, lymphocytes and CRP were calculated. Comparisons between influenza and other respiratory viral pneumonia WBC and CRP means were made. Student’s t-test was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: We analyzed 183 patients with positive viral pneumonia cases; of which, 37 (20.2%) had two viruses detected. Mean age was 1 year old and 56.5% were male. Viral detections were rhinovirus 75 (40.9%), RSV 45 (24.5%), influenza 31 (16.9%), metapneumovirus 30 (16.3%), bocavirus 20 (10.9%), parainfluenza 14 (7.6%), coronavirus 3 (1.6%) and adenovirus 2 (1.1%). Mean influenza WBC were 10,900 ± 2040/μL, neutrophils were 6998 ± 1510/μL, lymphocytes 2882 ± 826/μL and CRP 5.41 ± 1.9 mg/dL. Mean influenza negative, viral-positive pneumonia were WBC 12227 ± 868/μL, neutrophils 6787 ± 696/μL, lymphocytes 4469 ± 426/μL, CRP 2.81 ± 0.56 mg/dL. Lower lymphocyte counts (P = 0.002) and higher CRP levels (P = 0.019) were found in patients with influenza comparing them with pneumonia caused by other viruses. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, children with positive influenza pneumonia showed lower levels of lymphocytes and higher levels of CRP compared with negative influenza. Lower lymphocyte counts and high CRP levels have been found in influenza-positive patients mainly in adult studies. In children with suspected influenza pneumonia, lower lymphocyte counts and higher CRP levels can aid clinical diagnosis before molecular confirmation in influenza pneumonia.",2021-03-26,"Cristerna Tarrasa, G H; González Saldaña, N; Hernández Porras, M; Fortes Gutiérrez, S",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8083660/,,2021,356

Methods We conducted an individual participant data (IPD) systematic review of longitudinal studies of RT-PCR test results in symptomatic SARS-CoV-2. We searched PubMed, LitCOVID, medRxiv and COVID-19 Living Evidence databases. We assessed risk of bias using a QUADAS-2 adaptation. Outcomes were the percentage of positive test results by time and the duration of detectable virus, by anatomical sampling sites. Findings Of 5078 studies screened, we included 32 studies with 1023 SARS-CoV-2 infected participants and 1619 test results, from -6 to 66 days post-symptom onset and hospitalisation. The highest percentage virus detection was from nasopharyngeal sampling between 0 to 4 days post-symptom onset at 89% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83 to 93) dropping to 54% (95% CI 47 to 61) after 10 to 14 days. On average, duration of detectable virus was longer with lower respiratory tract (LRT) sampling than upper respiratory tract (URT). Duration of faecal and respiratory tract virus detection varied greatly within individual participants. In some participants, virus was still detectable at 46 days post-symptom onset. Interpretation RT-PCR misses detection of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection; early sampling minimises false negative diagnoses. Beyond ten days post-symptom onset, lower RT or faecal testing may be preferred sampling sites.

In our analysis, we define public transport as the bus, tram, metro and trolley operations which are ordered and funded by 11 local authorities in Poland; we also assume that the modal shift is reflected in the growth of traffic congestion. Taking into account these assumptions and considering the long-term financial data from 2010 to 2020, we then conduct hierarchical linear regression and state that cities with a higher share of current expenses in cities’ total annual transport expenditure have registered during the pandemic a lower number of weeks with congestion level exceeding the pre-pandemic level. We argue that this is due to the allocation of current expenditure to cleaning services and the transport service supply, which could have a significant impact on perceptions of crowding and safety on public transport. Both issues belong to the essential determinants of the quality of public transport services and could play a key role in mitigating the modal shift by reducing the fear of catching Covid-19. In contrast to this finding, we also show that investment expenditure (allocated to improvements of transport infrastructure) does not have a similar impact on the congestion during the pandemic. In this context, we emphasise that cutting spending on cleaning services and the transport supply service as a response to the reduced number of passengers would be more devastating for public transport than postponing new infrastructure investments. Based on the results achieved in the analysis, we provide recommendations for local authorities that can help implement new funding models and reframe local transport policy, namely: (1) close the funding gap resulting from lower revenues to local budgets, (2) provide resources for maintaining the infrastructure investments and adapting them to a “new normality”, (3) maintain the attractiveness of public transport post-Covid.",2022-03-09,"Krysiński, Dawid; Uss-Lik, Aneta",Case Stud Transp Policy,,document_parses/pdf_json/c653241ce7d69c4421392b49a7b7475851c2d558.json; document_parses/pdf_json/8de072b1481e66bbc08cf40e1c63bc08a438c9bc.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213624X22000566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35291373/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213624X22000566?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cstp.2022.03.004,247295656.0,2022,334

RPM consumption differs between certain population groups, and moreover, encompasses various subjective meanings. Literature on determinants of subjective importance of meat in diet (SIM), however, is scarce. Aims of this study were to determine which sociodemographic and -economic characteristics associate with SIM and RPM consumption. The study was based on the FinHealth 2017 Study. The sample comprised 4671 participants aged 18-74 years. SIM was asked with a question including five response options from ""not important at all"" to ""very important"". Habitual dietary intake including RPM consumption was studied with a food frequency questionnaire. RPM consumption level grew in parallel with SIM categories. RPM consumption was high and SIM prevailing in men, those living in rural areas, and those with low education. Women living in household with children consumed more RPM than other women but did not find meat more important. Conversely, men living in household with children found meat more important but did not consume it more than other men. Domain analyses considering individuals within the highest RPM consumption quintile revealed that the oldest age group found meat significantly less important than the youngest group. In order to be able to lower RPM consumption at population level and to move towards healthier and climate-wiser diets, it is important to identify subgroups that consume much meat but also subgroups that find meat especially important. Such dietary transition may be especially challenging to subgroups that consume much meat and also consider it important.

The most common molecular tests approved by regulatory bodies across the world for COVID-19 diagnosis are based on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). While PCR-based tests are highly sensitive, specific, and remarkably reliable, they have many limitations ranging from the requirement of sophisticated laboratories, need of skilled personnel, use of complex protocol, long wait times for results, and an overall high cost per test. These limitations have inspired researchers to search for alternative diagnostic methods that are fast, economical, and executable in low-resource laboratory settings. The discovery of Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP) has provided a reliable substitute platform for the accurate detection of low copy number nucleic acids in the diagnosis of several viral diseases, including epidemics like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). At present, a cocktail of LAMP assay reagents along with reverse transcriptase enzyme (Reverse Transcription LAMP, RT-LAMP) can be a robust solution for the rapid and cost-effective diagnosis for COVID-19, particularly in developing, and low-income countries. In summary, the development of RT-LAMP based diagnostic tools in a paper/strip format or the integration of this method into a microfluidic platform such as a Lab-on-a-chip may revolutionize the concept of PoCT for COVID-19 diagnosis.

The aim of this study was to assess SARS-CoV-2 infections in nephrologists in the first and second pandemic waves, describing risk factors and clinical features. METHODS: This national survey was sent to Spanish nephrologists. Epidemiological data, comorbidities and medications were collected and compared between infected and non-infected nephrologists. Symptoms, prescribed treatments and outcomes are described for infected nephrologists. RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty-seven nephrologists (66% female, age 46 ± 11 years) completed the survey.

As part of the essential processes for both of these applications, the two strands of double-stranded DNA are sequentially cleaved by a single catalytic site of Cas12a, but the mechanistic details that govern the generation of complete breaks in double-stranded DNA remain to be elucidated. Here, using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay, we identified two conformational intermediates that form consecutively following the initial cleavage of the nontarget strand. Specifically, these two intermediates are the result of further unwinding of the target DNA in the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM)–distal region and the subsequent binding of the target strand to the catalytic site. Notably, the PAM-distal DNA unwound conformation was stabilized by Mg(2+) ions, thereby significantly promoting the binding and cleavage of the target strand.

It is one of the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders and has complex aetiology, both genetic and environmental. There is a perceived decrease in skill acquirement, leading to insufficient income and job opportunities as adults, which drives them towards poor physical and mental outcomes compared to their contemporaries without ADHD. The impact of heavy metals on ADHD is a topic of interest but is much less studied. Copper has been implicated as a pro-oxidant and in the metal accelerated production of free radicals that may affect oxidative stress. Zinc also serves as an antioxidant, and changes in its concentrations may impact the homeostasis of oxidative stress. Methods Twenty-four children diagnosed with ADHD were taken as cases and matched with 24 healthy controls. Hair and urine samples were collected from all the study participants. The samples were collected in sterile containers according to established protocols. Acid digestion of hair samples was done using 65% nitric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide. Urine samples were extracted by a solution of 0.1% Triton-X-100 and 1% ultrapure nitric acid. The levels of zinc and copper were determined in both samples by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The copper/zinc ratio (Cu/Zn) was calculated from these values. Mann Whitney U Test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were done to estimate statistical significance. Results The median age of the study population was eight years. Overall, 34 male and 14 female subjects participated. There was no significant difference in height, weight and BMI between the cases and controls. Hair zinc levels in the ADHD group (198.49 µg g(-1) of hair) was significantly lower than the control group (527.05 µg g(-1) of hair). However, hair copper levels were increased significantly in the ADHD children (14.01 µg g(-1) of hair) compared to the controls (7.43 µg g(-1) of hair). Urine zinc levels were significantly lower in cases than controls (525.7 µg g(-1) of spot urine creatinine vs 1374.09 µg g(-1) of spot urine creatinine). However, copper levels in urine were higher in the ADHD children (17.01 µg g(-1) of spot urine creatinine compared to 7.26 µg g(-1) of spot urine creatinine in controls). Both hair and urine copper to zinc ratio was significantly higher in the ADHD group. On ROC analysis, the hair Cu/Zn ratio had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.920 (p-value <0.001), and the urine Cu/Zn ratio had an AUC of 0.967 (p-value <0.001). When used as a diagnostic classifier for ADHD based on the cut-off value determined by ROC, both hair and urine Cu/Zn ratio had high sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion Low zinc levels in the urine and hair of children and higher levels of copper may impact the aetiology of ADHD in these children. At an early stage, the Cu/Zn ratio in both hair and urine samples may be used as a precise biomarker to identify and monitor such children.",2021-12-25,"Nayak, Saurav; Sahu, Suchanda; Patra, Suravi; John, Joseph",Cureus,,document_parses/pdf_json/f887716d32fc4f162984678639281d8a79bacd0d.json,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.20692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35106229/,245499931.0,2021,492

OBJECTIVE: : This review aimed to synthesize the capabilities of m-health in providing health services to the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify the factors contributing to the success of these tools. METHODS: : To find the relevant studies, a search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, and Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria were: studies in English that used m-health intervention in all aspects of elderly healthcare during the COVID-19 outbreak, were published in peer-reviewed journals from 31 December 2019, and had any research design and methodology. Two authors independently took all the steps of this review, and finally performed narrative synthesis to report the findings. RESULTS: : Our initial search identified 421 studies, of which 10 met the inclusion criteria.

DESIGN: We used an exploratory qualitative study design. SETTING: Mombasa and Kilifi Counties of Coastal Kenya. PARTICIPANTS: 25 key informants including community leaders, professionals and community members directly and indirectly affected by suicidality. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with purposively selected key informants to collect data on sociocultural perspectives of suicide. Thematic analysis was used to identify key themes using both inductive and deductive processes. RESULTS: Four key themes were identified from the inductive content analysis of 25 in-depth interviews as being important for understanding cultural perspectives related to suicidality: (1) the stigma of suicidal behaviour, with suicidal victims perceived as weak or crazy, and suicidal act as evil and illegal; (2) the attribution of supernatural causality to suicide, for example, due to sorcery or inherited curses; (3) the convoluted pathway to care, specifically, delayed access to biomedical care and preference for informal healers; and (4) gender and age differences influencing suicide motivation, method of suicide and care seeking behaviour for suicidality. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an in depth understanding of cultural factors attributed to suicide in this rural community that may engender stigma, discrimination and poor access to mental healthcare in this community.

Upon activation of the gene switch, the vectors replicate in infected cells with an efficacy that approaches that of the wild-type virus from which they were derived. Essentially no replication occurs in the absence of activation. When administered to mice, localized application of a transient heat treatment in the presence of systemic antiprogestin results in efficient but limited virus replication at the site of administration. The immunogenicity of these viral vectors was tested in a mouse footpad lethal challenge model. Unactivated viral vectors—which may be regarded as equivalents of inactivated vaccines—induced detectable protection against lethality caused by wild-type virus challenge. Single activation of the viral vectors at the site of administration (rear footpads) greatly enhanced protective immune responses, and a second immunization resulted in complete protection. Once activated, vectors also induced far better neutralizing antibody and HSV-1-specific cellular immune responses than unactivated vectors. To find out whether the immunogenicity of a heterologous antigen was also enhanced in the context of efficient transient vector replication, a virus vector constitutively expressing an equine influenza virus hemagglutinin was constructed. Immunization of mice with this recombinant induced detectable antibody-mediated neutralization of equine influenza virus, as well as a hemagglutinin-specific cellular immune response. Single activation of viral replication resulted in a severalfold enhancement of these immune responses. IMPORTANCE We hypothesized that vigorous replication of a pathogen may be critical for eliciting the most potent and balanced immune response against it. Hence, attenuation/inactivation (as in conventional vaccines) should be avoided. Instead, the necessary safety should be provided by placing replication of the pathogen under stringent control and by activating time-limited replication of the pathogen strictly in an administration region in which pathology cannot develop. Immunization will then occur in the context of highly efficient pathogen replication and uncompromised safety. We found that localized activation in mice of efficient but limited replication of a replication-competent controlled herpesvirus vector resulted in a greatly enhanced immune response to the virus or an expressed heterologous antigen. This finding supports the above-mentioned hypothesis and suggests that the vectors may be promising novel agents worth exploring for the prevention/mitigation of infectious diseases for which efficient vaccination is lacking, in particular in immunocompromised patients.",2018-07-31,"Bloom, David C.; Tran, Robert K.; Feller, Joyce; Voellmy, Richard",J Virol,,document_parses/pdf_json/fbaaee7a5ac9ab3324e82bc7b8706edc5bd1524e.json,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00616-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29899091/,49187116.0,2018,401

On February 5, 2020, the number of suspected cases of NCP in China mainland reached a maximum of 5,328. Since then, the suspected cases have shown a significant downward trend. On February 4, 2020, the number of confirmed cases has gradually decreased in China mainland since then. On February 12, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of NCP in China mainland increased explosively to 15,152, and then began to decline. From February 3, 2020, except for Hubei Province, In China mainland, the number of newly confirmed cases of NCP has continued to decline; From December 1, 2019 to February 14, 2020, a total of 1,523 cases of NCP deaths in China mainland, a cumulative cure of 8096 cases, and mortality and cure rate were 2.29% (1523/66492) and 12.18% (8096/66492) respectively; Starting from January 27, 2020, The spread index of NCP gradually declined, and the extinction index of NCP rose little by little from January 29, 2020. [Conclusion] Starting from February 5, 2020, the number of suspected cases of the NCP is gradually decrease in China mainland. From February 3, 2020, the number of newly confirmed cases of NCP is continuous decline in China mainland except Hubei Province, This shows that the control of the transmission of NCP has achieved. Judged from the number of confirmed cases of NCP, controlling the outbreak in China mainland is to control the epidemic in Hubei province, and the key to controlling the outbreak in Hubei province is to control the epidemic in Wuhan city; Judging from the gradual increase in the number and cure rate of the NCP, and the gradual decline in the number of deaths and mortality, the trend of outbreak control and treatment is getting better; A decrease of the NCP spread index indicates a slowdown in the spread of the virus, but the cumulative confirmed cases is still increase, so the epidemic will continue for some time. However, the turning point of the epidemic in mainland China has not yet occurred. On February 12, 2020, the turning point of the epidemic in China mainland except Hubei province, has turned up.",2020-02-18,"youbin, Liu; bao hong, Li",,,document_parses/pdf_json/dac1b1607ae72b9509ab26367e0d55016e8132a8.json,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.17.20024034,213818202.0,2020,433

We demonstrate that the single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be used at BSL-2 laboratories for high-throughput neutralization and antiviral testing. The trans-complementation system consists of two components: a genomic viral RNA containing a deletion of ORF3 and envelope gene, and a producer cell line expressing the two deleted genes. Trans-complementation of the two components generates virions that can infect naive cells for only one round, but does not produce wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Hamsters and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with the complementation-derived virions exhibited no detectable disease, even after intracranial inoculation with the highest possible dose.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: General medical and elderly inpatient wards in a hospital in England. METHODS: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients were classified as community or healthcare associated by time from admission to onset or positivity using European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control definitions. COVID-19 symptoms were classified as asymptomatic, nonrespiratory, or respiratory. Infectiousness was calculated from 2 days prior to 14 days after symptom onset or positive test. Cases were defined as healthcare-associated COVID-19 when infection was acquired from the wards under investigation. COVID-19 exposures were calculated based on symptoms and bed proximity to an infectious patient. Risk ratios and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were calculated from univariable and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 153 patients, 65 were COVID-19 patients and 45 of these were healthcare-associated cases. Exposure to a COVID-19 patient with respiratory symptoms was associated with healthcare-associated infection irrespective of proximity (aOR, 3.81; 95% CI, 1.6.3–8.87). Nonrespiratory exposure was only significant within 2.5 m (aOR, 5.21; 95% CI, 1.15–23.48). A small increase in risk ratio was observed for exposure to a respiratory patient for >1 day compared to 1 day from 2.04 (95% CI, 0.99–4.22) to 2.36 (95% CI, 1.44–3.88). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory exposure anywhere within a 4-bed bay was a risk, whereas nonrespiratory exposure required bed distance ≤2.5 m. Standard infection control measures required beds to be >2 m apart. Our findings suggest that this may be insufficient to stop SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

METHODS AND RESULTS The lactobacilli putative probiotic (SynForU-HerCare; two capsules/day of 9.5 log CFU/capsule) or placebo was administered for 8-weeks in a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study. Subjects were assessed for vaginal and gut health conditions at baseline, week-4 and week-8 via questionnaires. The vulvovaginal symptom questionnaire not only covered aspects pertaining to vulvovaginal symptoms but also the quality of life impacts such as emotional, social and sexual. The administration of lactobacilli reduced symptoms of irritation (P=0.023) and discharge (P=0.011) starting week-4 and continued after week-8 (P<0.05), accompanied by reduced symptoms for burning after week-8 (P=0.046) as compared to the placebo. Patients consuming lactobacilli also showed reduced concern about symptoms after week-4 (P=0.010) and continued after week-8 (P=0.001), accompanied by reduced impairment of daily activities attributed to vulvovaginal symptoms (P=0.012) and continued after week-8 (P=0.026). Insignificant differences were observed for sexual impacts between treatment groups. The administration of lactobacilli also reduced recurrences of both emotional and social stress as compared to the placebo at both week-4 and week-8 (P<0.05). Patients consuming lactobacilli showed higher defecation times per week at week-4 (P=0.010) and week-8 (P=0.001) as compared to the placebo group, indicating potential to reduce risks of pregnancy-induced constipation. CONCLUSIONS Lactobacilli probiotics are beneficial towards pregnant women, especially in reducing vulvovaginal symptoms and recurrences of VC, accompanied by improved emotional and social distress attributed to VC. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY The study demonstrated the preventive and modulatory roles of lactobacilli strains against VC in pregnant women.

This new conformation—an open trimer— contains easily accessible RBDs. It exposes the conserved trimer interface buried in the prefusion conformation, thus exposing potential epitopes for pan-coronavirus antibody and ligand recognition.

Yet, few studies have systematically examined racial/ethnic differences in mental health outcomes in this context. METHODS: Data came from the COVID-19 Southern Cities Study, a probability-based, cross-sectional study conducted in May/June 2020 among adults living in the metropolitan statistical areas of Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, Houston, and New Orleans. Unadjusted and adjusted associations between racial/ethnic identity and past-week depression and/or anxiety symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2 score ≥ 3 or Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 score ≥ 3), trouble sleeping, physical reactions when thinking about COVID-19, and self-rated worsened mental health due to the pandemic were estimated in separate logistic regression models. RESULTS: Over 30% of respondents reported depression and/or anxiety symptoms, 21% reported physical reactions, 25% had trouble sleeping, and 33% worsened mental health since the pandemic began. Adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related characteristics and pandemic-related stressors, odds of anxiety symptoms (odds ratio (OR) 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30–0.95) and worsened mental health (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36–0.94) were lower among non-Hispanic Black vs. non-Hispanic white respondents. LIMITATIONS: No diagnostic assessments were used, and results may not be generalizable to later phases of the pandemic and the entire U.S. South.

We examined the anxiety symptom in Japanese women during pregnancy using a self-administered questionnaire under the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Between April 2020 and March 2021 (2020, the COVID-19 pandemic), we asked 248 Japanese women without history of mental disorders who delivered singleton neonates at 37-41 weeks’ gestation to answer the two-item generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-2) at first, second, and third trimesters of gestation. We also asked 311 women with the same situation between January 2019 and December 2019 (2019) as control. RESULTS: The women with anxiety symptom were common during the first trimester of gestation irrespective of COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, the proportion of the women with anxiety symptom decreased as the trimester of pregnancy progressed (p < 0.01); however, in 2020, the proportion of women with anxiety symptom did not decrease during pregnancy.

The built environment that facilitates crowding increases exposure and hence transmission of COVID-19 as evidenced by outbreaks in both cool-dry and hot-humid climates, such as in the US prison system and dormitories in Singapore, respectively. This paper explores how the built environment influences crowding and COVID-19 transmission, focusing on informal urban settlements (slums). We propose policy and practice changes that could reduce COVID-19 transmission. There are several issues on how COVID-19 affects informal urban settlements. Slum populations tend to be younger than the overall population. Lower numbers of older people lessen the morbidity and mortality of the pandemic in slum areas. Second, many slum populations are highly mobile. By returning to their ancestral villages residents can avoid the risks of overcrowding and reduce the population density in a given area but may spread COVID-19 to other areas. Third, detection and registration of COVID-19 cases depends on patients presenting to health care providers. If the risk of visiting a health care centre outweighs the potential benefits patients may prefer not to seek treatment. The control and prevention of COVID-19 in informal urban settlements starts with organizing community infrastructure for diagnosis and treatment and assuring that basic needs (food, water, sanitation, health care and public transport) are met during quarantine. Next, community members at highest risk need to be identified and protected. Low-income, informal settlements need to be recognized as a reservoir and source for persistent transmission. Solutions to overcrowding must be developed for this and future pandemics. In view of the constant risk that slums present to the entire population decisive steps need to be taken to rehabilitate and improve informal settlements, while avoiding stigmatization.",2020-11-22,"von Seidlein, Lorenz; Alabaster, Graham; Deen, Jacqueline; Knudsen, Jakob",Build Environ,,document_parses/pdf_json/14efda3b0b6d7b7ec41e5bb98fc91f7a09186101.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33250561/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.107472; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132320308398?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132320308398,227121844.0,2020,282

Data on HH compliance in companion animal veterinary institutions in Europe are sparse. METHODS: This observational study assessed HH according to WHO standards in three large and two medium‐sized clinics and two primary care practices in Switzerland. Associations with HH indication, professional group, clinical area and institution were determined using a generalized linear mixed effects model. RESULTS: Based on 2056 observations, overall HH compliance [95% confidence interval] was 32% [30%–34%]. HH compliance was highest in the consultation area (41% [38%–45%]) and after contact to body fluids (45% [40%–50%]), and lowest in the pre‐OR area (20% [15%–24%]) and before clean/aseptic procedures (12% [9%–15%]). Veterinarians showed a higher HH compliance (37% [34%–40%]) than veterinary nurses (25% [22%–28%]). HH compliance was lower before clean/aseptic procedures compared to all other indications (all p < 0.015 except ‘before touching a patient’ in medium‐sized clinics/practices, p = 0.095) and higher in the consultation area compared to all other areas in large clinics (all p < 0.04).

Due to this, Polish patients have gained access to continuation of outpatient specialist healthcare using information and communication technologies. The goal of the study was to recognize the needs and expectations as well as the main concerns of Polish rheumatology patients in regard to teleconsultations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online-based questionnaire comprising 17 single choice and multiple choice, open-end questions was collected among Polish rheumatology patients directly after the introduction of specialist teleconsultations. RESULTS: 244 respondents completed the survey. Mean age of the respondents was 40.6 ±10.5 and 92.6% of them were female. 48% of the respondents lived not further than 20 kilometres from their outpatient rheumatology clinic. The mean severity of current symptoms, assessed by patients on a visual-analogue scale, was 4.9 ±2.4. 82% of the respondents selected telephone consultations as the most convenient form of receiving rheumatology advice. The patients highlighted the lack of physical examination (43%) and additional tests (43.9%) as the factors discouraging them from teleconsultations; 8.2% of respondents were against maintaining rheumatology teleconsultations after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; 3.7% of the respondents received information on teleconsultations from a medical professional.

The epidemic trend was analyzed using joinpoint regressions; the growth of affected countries was by descriptive analysis; and the global distribution and transmission trend by spatial analysis. FINDINGS: The number of new cases in the regions outside of China slowly increased before 24(th) Feb. and rapidly accelerated after 24(th) Feb. Compared to China, other affected countries experienced a longer duration of a slow increase at the early stage and rapid growth at the latter stages. The first apparent increase in the number of affected countries occurred from 23(rd) Jan to 1(st) Feb, and the second apparent increase started from 25(th) Feb. The fist COVID-19 cases reported by countries from 28(th) Feb. were mainly imported from Europe. The geographic distribution changed from single-center (13(th) Jan. - 20(th) Feb.) to multi-centers pattern (20(th) Feb. – 14(th) Mar.).

Performance of the model was validated as satisfactory in 82% of the 50 test countries, while asking for prediction for 10 days beyond the period of training. Accuracy of the above prediction with days beyond training was assessed in comparison with the MAPE that the model gave with cumulative global data. The model was applied to study correlation between the growth of infection and deaths, and a number of effectors that may influence the epidemic. The model identified age groups, trade with China, air traffic, country temperature and CoV-2 virus types as the likely effectors of infection and virulence leading to deaths. The predictors likely to promote or suppress the epidemic were identified. Some of the predictors had significant effect on the shape parameters of Weibull distribution.

The average monthly relative humidity data for the period 2000–2016 have been used to carry out the objectives of the proposed study. The forecast trend in relative humidity declines from 2017 to 2025. The accuracy of the models has been measured using root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The results showed that the SARIMA model provides the forecasted relative humidity with RMSE of 6.04 and MAE of 4.56. On the other hand, MLP model reported the forecasted relative humidity with RMSE of 4.65 and MAE of 3.42.

We aimed to evaluate whether an online education module affects weight bias and knowledge about obesity in a private medical center setting. METHODS An open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted among all employees of a chain of private medical centers in Israel (n=3,290). Employees who confirmed their consent to participate in the study were randomized into intervention or control (i.e., 'no intervention') arms. The study intervention was an online 15-minute educational module that included obesity, weight bias, stigma, and discrimination information. Questionnaires on Anti-Fat Attitudes ('AFA'), fat-phobia ('F-scale), and beliefs about the causes of obesity were answered at baseline (i.e., right before the intervention), 7-days, and 30-days post-intervention. RESULTS A total of 506, 230, and 145 employees responded to the baseline, 7-day, and 30-day post-intervention questionnaires, respectively. Mean participant age was 43.3±11.6 years, 84.6% were women, and 67.4% held an academic degree. Mean F-scale scores and percentage of participants with above-average fat-phobic attitudes (≥3.6) significantly decreased only within the intervention group over time (P≤0.042). However, no significant differences between groups over time were observed for AFA scores or factors beliefs to cause obesity. CONCLUSIONS A single exposure to an online education module on weight bias and knowledge about obesity may confer only a modest short-term improvement in medical center employees fat-phobic attitudes toward people with obesity. Future studies should examine if re-exposure to such intervention could impact weight bias, stigma, and discrimination among medical center staff in the long-term.",2022-01-21,"Sherf-Dagan, Shiri; Kessler, Yafit; Mardy-Tilbor, Limor; Raziel, Asnat; Sakran, Nasser; Boaz, Mona; Kaufman-Shriqui, Vered",Obesity facts,,,https://doi.org/10.1159/000521856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35066508/,246238698.0,2022,250

In hospital settings, both medical staff and patients are required to wear PPE. As these facilities resume regular operations, staff will be required to wear PPE at all times while additional PPE will be mandated during medical procedures. This will put increased pressure on hospitals which have had problems predicting PPE usage and sourcing its supply. To meet this challenge, we propose an approach to predict demand for PPE. Specifically, we model the admission of patients to a medical department using multiple independent [Formula: see text] queues. Each queue represents a class of patients with similar treatment plans and hospital length-of-stay. By estimating the total workload of each class, we derive closed-form estimates for the expected amount of PPE required over a specified time horizon using current PPE guidelines. We apply our approach to a data set of 22,039 patients admitted to the general internal medicine department at St. Michael’s hospital in Toronto, Canada from April 2010 to November 2019. We find that gloves and surgical masks represent approximately 90% of predicted PPE usage. We also find that while demand for gloves is driven entirely by patient-practitioner interactions, 86% of the predicted demand for surgical masks can be attributed to the requirement that medical practitioners will need to wear them when not interacting with patients.",2021-04-12,"Furman, Eugene; Cressman, Alex; Shin, Saeha; Kuznetsov, Alexey; Razak, Fahad; Verma, Amol; Diamant, Adam",Health Care Manag Sci,,document_parses/pdf_json/4a1884832813b28c18db32ee8a92860db803ccde.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10729-021-09561-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33843005/,226254226.0,2021,238

Factors determining emergence of flaviviruses and continuing circulation in sylvatic cycles are incompletely understood. Here we identify potential sylvatic reservoirs of flaviviruses and characterize the macro-ecological traits common to known wildlife hosts to predict the risk of sylvatic flavivirus transmission among wildlife and identify regions that could be vulnerable to outbreaks. We evaluate variability in wildlife hosts for zoonotic flaviviruses and find that flaviviruses group together in distinct clusters with similar hosts. Models incorporating ecological and climatic variables as well as life history traits shared by flaviviruses predict new host species with similar host characteristics. The combination of vector distribution data with models for flavivirus hosts allows for prediction of global vulnerability to flaviviruses and provides potential targets for disease surveillance in animals and humans.,2018-12-21,"Pandit, Pranav S.; Doyle, Megan M.; Smart, Katrina M.; Young, Cristin C.

Although stress resulting from social isolation may increase cancer progression, its interference on tumorigenesis is poorly known. In this study, we used a preclinical model to evaluate the effects of social isolation stress on chemically induced oral carcinogenesis. Sixty-two 21-day-old male Wistar rats were divided into isolated and grouped groups. After 90 days of age, the rats from both groups underwent oral carcinogenesis with 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) for 20 weeks. All rats were assessed for depressive-like behavior and euthanized for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) diagnosis and measurement of inflammatory mediators in the tumor microenvironment. Social isolation stress increased the OSCC occurrence by 20.4% when compared to control. Isolated rats also showed higher tumor volume and cachexia than the grouped rats. Social isolation did not induce changes in the depressive-like behavior after carcinogenic induction. Tumors from stressed rats had increased levels of the inflammatory mediators, TNF-alpha, IL1-beta and MCP-1. The concentrations of TNF-alpha and MCP-1 were significantly increased in the large tumors from isolated animals.

The aim of this study was to provide estimates of the size of vulnerable populations at high risk for a severe COVID-19 course in Germany based on the currently available risk factor data. METHODS: We used nationwide outpatient claims data from the years 2010 to 2019 collected according to § 295 of the Code of Social Law V, covering data for all statutory health insurees (SHI) which is nearly 87% of the entire German population. We considered 15 chronic disorders based on the current state of knowledge about clinically relevant risk factors. Three risk groups for a severe COVID-19 course were defined: 1. individuals in the age group 15 to 59 years with at least two comorbid disorders; 2. individuals aged 60 to 79 years with at least one disorder and 3. all individuals 80 years and older irrespective of the presence of chronic conditions. Regional analysis was conducted at the level of administrative districts (n = 401). RESULTS: Overall, 26% of individuals over 15 years were at high risk for a severe COVID-19 course in 2019 amounting to a total number of nearly 18.5 million individuals in Germany. This included 3.8 million individuals in risk group 1, 9.2 million in risk group 2, and 5.4 million in risk group 3, corresponding to 8, 50 and 100% of German inhabitants in the respective age groups. On the level of the 17 administrative regions formed by the Association of SHI Physicians (ASHIP regions), the proportion of individuals at high risk ranged between 21% in Hamburg and 35% in Saxony-Anhalt. Small-area estimates varied between 18% in Freiburg (Baden-Württemberg) and 39% in the district Elbe-Elster (Brandenburg). CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides small-area estimates of populations at high risk for a severe COVID-19 course.

High demand of vaccines worldwide requires optimization of the production process. Perfusion process increases cell concentration and volumetric productivity, so that it becomes the commonly used strategy in vaccine production In this study, we optimized and developed a perfusion process for the adenovirus-based zoster vaccine production efficiently. We first tested different perfusion strategies in shake flasks, showing semi-continuous strategies for optimal HEK 293 cell growth. We then evaluated three empirical key process parameters (cell concentration at the time of infection (VCC), multiplicity of infection (MOI), virus production pH) by the design of experiment (DoE) method, from which the robust setpoint (VCC 1.04 × 10(7) cells/mL, MOI 9, and virus production pH 7.17) was confirmed in both shake flask and 2 L benchtop bioreactor. In the bioreactor, we compared the performances of two perfusion systems, the commercially-available XCell ATF® system and a novel peristaltic pump-driven alternating tangential flow perfusion system (PATFP system) that we developed. During cell cultivation stage, both perfusion systems have comparable performances regarding viable cell concentration and cell viability. At 2 dpi, the PATFP system resulted in an adenovirus titer of 2.1 × 10(10) IFU/mL and cell-specific virus yield of 2,062 IFU/cell, reaching 75% and 77% of values for XCell ATF® system. This study demonstrates the perfusion process to be superior strategy for adenovirus-based vaccine production compared to the batch-mode strategy (1,467 IFU/cell).

One of the approaches often employed towards preventing the entry and proliferation of viruses is computer-aided inhibition studies to identify potent compounds that can inhibit activity of viral targets in the host through binding at the active site. In this study, we developed a pharmacophore model of reportedly potent drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and -2). The model was used to screen the ZINC database for commercially available compounds having similar features with the experimentally tested drugs. The top 3000 compounds retrieved were docked into the active sites of a homology-modelled TMPRSS2. Docking scores of the top binders were validated and the top-ranked compounds were subjected to ADME, Lipinski’s and medicinal Chemistry property predictions for druglikeness analyses. Two lead compounds, ZINC64606047 and ZINC05296775, were identified having binding affinities higher than those of the reference inhibitors, favorable interactions with TMPRSS2 active site residues and good ADME and medicinal chemistry properties. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to assess the stability and dynamics of the interactions of these compounds with TMPRSS2. Binding free energy and contribution energy evaluations were determined using MMPBSA method. Analyses of the trajectory dynamics collectively established further that the lead compounds bound and interacted stably with active site residues of TMPRSS2.

It looks particularly at the benefits of using participatory research in conjunction with traditional modelling methods to potentially improve disease research, control and management. Integrated approaches can lead to more realistic mathematical models which in turn can assist with making policy decisions that reduce disease and benefit local people. The emergence, risk, spread and control of diseases are affected by many complex bio-physical, environmental and socio-economic factors. These include climate and environmental change, land-use variation, changes in population and people’s behaviour. The evidence base for this scoping review comes from the work of a consortium, with the aim of integrating modelling approaches traditionally used in epidemiological, ecological and development research. A total of five examples of the impacts of participatory research on the choice of model structure are presented. Example 1 focused on using participatory research as a tool to structure a model. Example 2 looks at identifying the most relevant parameters of the system. Example 3 concentrates on identifying the most relevant regime of the system (e.g., temporal stability or otherwise), Example 4 examines the feedbacks from mathematical models to guide participatory research and Example 5 goes beyond the so-far described two-way interplay between participatory and mathematical approaches to look at the integration of multiple methods and frameworks. This scoping review describes examples of best practice in the use of participatory methods, illustrating their potential to overcome disciplinary hurdles and promote multidisciplinary collaboration, with the aim of making models and their predictions more useful for decision-making and policy formulation.

However, following a temporal delay infections started to expand to older age groups. A comprehensive understanding of such transmission dynamics will be key for managing the pandemic in the time to come and to anticipate future developments. The present study thus extends the scope of previous SARS-CoV-2-related research in Switzerland by contributing to deeper insight into the potential impact of “social mixing” of different age groups on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections. METHODS The present study examined persons aged 65 years and older with respect to possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure risks using longitudinal panel data from the Swiss COVID-19 Social Monitor. The study used data from two assessments (survey “May” and survey “August”). Survey “May” took place shortly after the release of the lockdown in Switzerland. Survey “August” was conducted in mid-August. To identify at-risk elderly persons, we conducted a combined factor/k-means clustering analysis of the survey data assessed in August in order to examine different patterns of adherence to recommended preventive measures. RESULTS In summary, 270 (survey “May”) and 256 (survey “August”) persons aged 65 years and older were analysed for the present study. Adherence to established preventive measures was similar across the two surveys, whereas adherence pertaining to social contacts decreased substantially from survey “May” to survey “August”. The combined factor/k-means clustering analysis to identify at-risk elderly individuals yielded four distinct groups with regard to different patterns of adherence to recommended preventive measures: a larger group of individuals with many social contacts but high self-reported adherence to preventive measures (n = 86); a small group with many social contacts and overall lower adherence (n = 26); a group with comparatively few contacts and few social activities (n = 66); and a group which differed from the latter through fewer contacts but more social activities (n = 78). Sociodemographic characteristics and risk perception with regard to SARS-CoV-2 infections among the four groups did not differ in a relevant way across the four groups. CONCLUSIONS Although many elderly persons continued to follow the recommended preventive measures during the transitional phase between the two pandemic waves, social mixing with younger persons constitutes a way for transmission of infections across age groups. Pandemic containment among all age groups thus remains essential to protect vulnerable populations, including the elderly.",2020-11-30,"Haag, Christina; Höglinger, Marc; Moser, André; Hämmig, Oliver; Puhan, Milo; von Wyl, Viktor",Swiss medical weekly,,,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2020.20416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33277915/,227298012.0,2020,406

Unfortunately, access to evidence‐based pain management interventions remains a challenge for many children and adolescents who suffer with persistent pain. Reducing patient burden and system‐level barriers to care are a central target of clinical innovations in pain treatment intervention. Psychological interventions are also increasingly focused on reducing biomedical biases that may inhibit attainment of services. While there are many new psychological interventions across an array of delivery platforms, few interventions have been systematically disseminated. This paper will highlight the translational research procedures that have informed the development and dissemination of the Comfort Ability Program (CAP), an interactive group‐based intervention teaching adolescents and their parents evidence‐based strategies to manage chronic or persistent pain. Now in its fifth year of dissemination, CAP has a demonstrated record of success with cross‐institutional implementation and sustainability at 18 hospitals across three countries. This paper reviews six dynamic and iterative phases of development, based on the Graham et al knowledge‐to‐action cycle (2006), that have guided the implementation and dissemination research for this program. The phases of CAP development include the following: (a) identifying knowledge and clinical gaps in care, (b) generating knowledge assets and implementation procedures, (c) evaluating clinical outcomes and system‐level processes, (d) developing and testing dissemination procedures, (e) expanding partnerships and monitoring knowledge use, and (f) sustaining knowledge use and continued innovation.

Liquid chromatography (LC) in combination with MS/MS has been a reliable method for detecting glycopeptides in digestion mixtures, and for assigning glycosylation sites and glycopeptide sequences. Direct interfacing of LC with MS relies on electrospray ionization, which produces ions with two, three or four charges for most proteolytic peptides and glycopeptides. MS/MS spectra of such glycopeptide ions often lead to ambiguous interpretation if deconvolution to the singly charged level is not used. In contrast, the matrix‐assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) technique usually produces singly charged peptide and glycopeptide ions. These ions require an extended m/z range, as provided by the quadrupole‐quadrupole time‐of‐flight (QqTOF) instrument used in these experiments, but the main advantages of studying singly charged ions are the simplicity and consistency of the MS/MS spectra. A first aim of the present study is to develop methods to recognize and use glycopeptide [M+H](+) ions as precursors for MS/MS, and thus for glycopeptide/glycoprotein identification as part of wider proteomics studies. Secondly, this article aims at demonstrating the usefulness of MALDI‐MS/MS spectra of N‐glycopeptides. Mixtures of diverse types of proteins, obtained commercially, were prepared and subjected to reduction, alkylation and tryptic digestion. Micro‐column reversed‐phase separation allowed deposition of several fractions on MALDI plates, followed by MS and MS/MS analysis of all peptides. Glycopeptide fractions were identified after MS by their specific m/z spacing patterns (162, 203, 291 u) between glycoforms, and then analyzed by MS/MS. In most cases, MS/MS spectra of [M+H](+) ions of glycopeptides featured peaks useful for determining sugar composition, peptide sequence, and thus probable glycosylation site. Peptide‐related product ions could be used in database search procedures and allowed the identification of the glycoproteins.

Methods Since mucosal immunity is critical for nasal prevention, we investigated an intramuscular PD1-based receptor-binding domain (RBD) DNA vaccine (PD1-RBD-DNA) and intranasal live attenuated influenza-based vaccines (LAIV-CA4-RBD and LAIV-HK68-RBD) against SARS-CoV-2. Findings Substantially higher systemic and mucosal immune responses, including bronchoalveolar lavage IgA/IgG and lung polyfunctional memory CD8 T cells, were induced by the heterologous PD1-RBD-DNA/LAIV-HK68-RBD as compared with other regimens. When vaccinated animals were challenged at the memory phase, prevention of robust SARS-CoV-2 infection in nasal turbinate was achieved primarily by the heterologous regimen besides consistent protection in lungs. The regimen-induced antibodies cross-neutralized variants of concerns. Furthermore, LAIV-CA4-RBD could boost the BioNTech vaccine for improved mucosal immunity.

Low-analytical-sensitivity nasal-swab testing is commonly used for surveillance and symptomatic testing, but the ability of these tests to detect the earliest stages of infection has not been established. In this study, conducted between September 2020 and June 2021 in the greater Los Angeles County, California, area, initially SARS-CoV-2-negative household contacts of individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 prospectively self-collected paired anterior-nares nasal-swab and saliva samples twice daily for viral-load quantification by high-sensitivity reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and digital-RT-PCR assays. We captured viral-load profiles from the incidence of infection for seven individuals and compared diagnostic sensitivities between respiratory sites. Among unvaccinated persons, testing saliva with a high-analytical-sensitivity assay detected infection up to 4.5 days before viral loads in nasal swabs reached concentrations detectable by low-analytical-sensitivity nasal-swab tests. For most participants, nasal swabs reached higher peak viral loads than saliva but were undetectable or at lower loads during the first few days of infection. High-analytical-sensitivity saliva testing was most reliable for earliest detection. Our study illustrates the value of acquiring early (within hours after a negative high-sensitivity test) viral-load profiles to guide the appropriate analytical sensitivity and respiratory site for detecting earliest infections. Such data are challenging to acquire but critical to designing optimal testing strategies with emerging variants in the current pandemic and to respond to future viral pandemics.",2022-02-16,"Savela, Emily S.; Viloria Winnett, Alexander; Romano, Anna E.; Porter, Michael K.; Shelby, Natasha; Akana, Reid; Ji, Jenny; Cooper, Matthew M.; Schlenker, Noah W.; Reyes, Jessica A.; Carter, Alyssa M.; Barlow, Jacob T.; Tognazzini, Colten; Feaster, Matthew; Goh, Ying-Ying; Ismagilov, Rustem F.",J Clin Microbiol,,document_parses/pdf_json/ddded02c40d5e854b1ebe21c798a5ad56f55f159.json; document_parses/pdf_json/2e0dcdd1890b60e9c3368c583d8a0f74988fb143.json,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.01785-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34911366/,245219530.0,2022,238

One key feature of SARS-CoV-2 is the presence of an enigmatic insertion in the spike glycoprotein gene representing a novel multibasic S1/S2 protease cleavage site. The proteolytic cleavage of the spike at this site is essential for viral entry into host cells. However, it has been systematically abrogated in structural studies in order to stabilize the spike in the prefusion state. In this study, multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations and ab initio modeling were leveraged to gain insights into the structures and dynamics of the loop containing the S1/S2 protease cleavage site. They unveiled distinct conformations, formations of short helices and interactions of the loop with neighboring glycans that could potentially regulate the accessibility of the cleavage site to proteases and its processing.

We found that the Ad5-nCoV booster induced potent neutralizing activity against the wild-type virus and Omicron variant, while aerosolized Ad5-nCoV generated the greatest neutralizing antibody responses against the Omicron variant at day 28 after booster vaccination, at 14.1-fold that of CoronaVac, 5.6-fold that of ZF2001 and 2.0-fold that of intramuscular Ad5-nCoV. Similarly, the aerosolized Ad5-nCoV booster produced the greatest IFNgamma T-cell response at day 14 after booster vaccination.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and proof-of-concept of cognitive-behavioral therapy for ARFID (CBT-AR) for adults. Males and females (ages 18–55 years) were offered 20–30 outpatient sessions of CBT-AR delivered by one of five therapists. Of 18 eligible adults offered CBT-AR, 15 chose to participate and 14 completed treatment. All patients endorsed high ratings of treatment credibility and expected improvement after the first session, and 93% of completers provided high ratings of satisfaction at the conclusion of treatment. Therapists rated the majority (80%) of patients as “much improved” or “very much improved.” Based on intent-to-treat analyses, ARFID severity on the Pica, ARFID, and Rumination Disorder Interview (PARDI) showed a large and significant decrease from pre- to post-treatment; and patients incorporated a mean of 18.0 novel foods. The underweight subgroup (n = 4) gained an average of 11.38 pounds, showing a large and significant increase in mean BMI from the underweight to the normal-weight range. At post-treatment, 47% of patients no longer met criteria for ARFID. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective treatment study of ARFID in adults. The findings of this study provide preliminary evidence of feasibility, acceptability, and proof-of-concept of CBT-AR for heterogeneous presentations of ARFID in adults.

PATIENTS/METHODS: Between September and December 2014, 126 nasopharyngeal samples (NPS) of hospitalized children <15 years of age with ARI were tested for the presence of respiratory viruses using a multiplex RT‐qPCR and EV‐D68‐specific RT‐qPCR. Clinical, epidemiological, and demographic data were collected and associated with symptomatology and viral infections. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using VP1 region. RESULTS: Enterovirus/rhinovirus infection was detected in 40 patients (31·7%), of which 24 patients were EV‐D68‐positive. EV‐D68 infection prevailed over September and October 2014 and was associated with neutrophilia and lymphopenia, and patients were more likely to develop hypoxemia. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Mexican EV‐D68 belongs to the new B1 clade.

Tools to help guide patients during this susceptible time are needed. Methods: To determine whether a smartphone application (app) deployed following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can safely improve the transition to ambulatory care, we customized content on a digital health platform for hospitalized patients receiving PCI which included education, tracking, reminders and live health coaches. We conducted a single-arm open-label pilot study of the app at two academic medical centers in a single health system, with subjects enrolled 02/2018-05/2019 and 1:3 propensity-matched historical controls from 01/2015-12/2017. To evaluate feasibility and efficacy, we assessed 30-day hospital readmission (primary), outpatient cardiovascular follow-up, and cardiac rehabilitation (CR) enrollment as recorded in the health system. Outcomes were assessed by Cox Proportional Hazards model. Results: 1676 patients were excluded due to pre-specified criteria including medical complexity, language barrier, and elderly age. 118 of 324 eligible (36.4%) 21-85 year-old patients who underwent PCI for either symptomatic CAD or acute coronary syndrome and who owned a smartphone or tablet enrolled. Mean age was 62.5 (9.7) years, 87 (73.7%) were male, 40 of 118 (33.9%) had type 2 diabetes mellitus, 68 (57.6%) enrolled underwent PCI for MI and 59 (50.0%) had previously known CAD; demographics were similar among matched historical controls. No significant difference existed in all-cause readmission within 30 days (8.5% app vs 9.6% control, p=0.699) or 90 days (16.1% app vs 19.5% control, p=0.394). Rates of both 90-day CR enrollment (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.30-3.06) and 1-month cardiovascular follow up (HR 1.83, 95% CI 1.43-2.34) were increased. Weekly engagement at 30- and 90-days, as measured by percentage of weeks with at least one day of completion of tasks, was mean (SD) 73.5% (33.9%) and 63.5% (40.3%). Spearman correlation analyses indicated similar engagement across age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusions: A post-PCI smartphone app with live health coaches yielded similarly high engagement across demographics and safely increased attendance in cardiac rehabilitation.

It is transmitted through droplets, contact, the fecal-oral route, and airborne transmission under certain conditions that allow droplets to combine with air particles to form an aerosol. Viral loads are higher in the nasal area and similar in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Medical situations have been classified into high and low risk of generating aerosols. Most procedures and surgery in otolaryngology correspond to high-risk medical situations. This review aims to gather the vast amount of available information and generate recommendations for different surgical procedures according to aerosolization risk and COVID-19 status, with use of specific personal protective equipment in each case. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and Food and Drug Administration. REVIEW METHODS: We conducted a review on the literature on personal protective equipment for otolaryngologic surgery and surgical indication restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 is an easily transmitted virus. Asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with COVID-19 present an upper airway high viral load, conferring otolaryngologic procedures a high risk of aerosolization. Surgical procedures must be categorized according to aerosolization risk and the possibility of COVID-19 diagnosis, according to use of personal protective equipment.

Since there is no specific therapy for this new coronavirus infection (COVID-19), searching for an effective and safe anti-inflammatory therapy is critical.Materials and methods This study evaluated efficacy and safety of pulse therapy with high doses of glucocorticosteroids (GCS), methylprednisolone 1,000 mg for 3 days plus dexamethasone 8 mg for another 3-5 days, in 17 patients with severe coronavirus pneumonia as a part of retrospective comparative analysis (17 patients in control group). The study primary endpoint was the aggregate dynamics of patients' condition as evaluated by an original CCS-COVID scale, which included, in addition to the clinical status, assessments of changes in the inflammation marker, C-reactive protein (CRP); the thrombus formation marker, D-dimer; and the extent of lung injury evaluated by computed tomography (CT). Patients had signs of lung injury (53.2 % and 25.6 %), increases in CRP 27 and 19 times, and a more than doubled level of D-dimer (to 1.41 µg/ml and 1.15 µg/ml) in the active therapy and the control groups, respectively. The GCS treatment group had a more severe condition at baseline.Results The GCS pulse therapy proved effective and significantly decreased the CCS-COVID scores. Median score difference was 5.00 compared to the control group (р=0.011). Shortness of breath considerably decreased; oxygen saturation increased, and the NEWS-2 clinical status scale scores decreased. In the GCS group, concentration of CRP significantly decreased from 134 mg/dl to 41.8 mg/dl (р=0.009) but at the same time, D-dimer level significantly increased from 1.41 µg/ml to 1.98 µg/ml (р=0.044). In the control group, the changes were nonsignificant. The dynamics of lung injury by CT was better in the treatment group but the difference did not reach a statistical significance (р=0.062). Following the GCS treatment, neutrophilia increased (р=0.0001) with persisting lymphopenia, and the neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio, a marker of chronic inflammation, increased 2.5 times (р=0.006). The changes in the N/L ratio and D-dimer were found to correlate in the GCS pulse therapy group (r =0.49, p=0.04), which underlined the relationship of chronic autoimmune inflammation with thrombus formation in COVID-19. No significant changes were observed in the control group. In result, four patients developed venous thromboembolic complications (two of them had pulmonary artery thromboembolism) after the GCS pulse therapy despite the concomitant antiplatelet treatment at therapeutic doses. Recovery was slower in the hormone treatment group (median stay in the hospital was 26 days vs 18 days in the control group, р=0.001).Conclusion Pulse therapy with high doses of GCS exerted a rapid anti-inflammatory effect but at the same time, increased the N/L ratio and the D-dimer level, which increased the risk of thromboembolism.",2020-07-07,"Mareev, V Yu; Orlova, Ya A; Pavlikova, E P; Matskeplishvili, S T; Krasnova, T N; Malahov, P S; Samokhodskaya, L M; Mershina, E A; Sinitsyn, V E; Mareev, Yu V; Kalinkin, A L; Begrambekova, Yu L; Kamalov, A A",Kardiologiia,,,https://doi.org/10.18087/cardio.2020.6.n1226; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32720612/,220842515.0,2020,464

There is a growing body of evidence suggesting a close link exists between an increased risk of infection and an increased severity of lung injury and mortality, in patients infected with COVID-19 who have existing hypertension. This is thought to be due to the possible involvement of the virus target receptor, ACE2, in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blood pressure management system. Objective: To investigate the association between hypertension as an existing comorbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: A systematic literature search in several databases was performed to identify studies that comment on hypertension as an existing comorbidity, and its effect on mortality in hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID- 19 infection. The results of these studies were then pooled, and a meta-analysis was peformed to assess the overall effect of hypertension as an existing comorbidity on risk of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 positive patients. Results: A total of 12243 hospitalised patients were pooled from 19 studies. All studies demonstrated a higher fatality rate in hypertensive COVID-19 patients when compared to non-hypertensive patients. Meta-analysis of the pooled studies also demonstrated that hypertension was associated with increased mortality in hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection (risk ratio (RR) 2.57 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.10, 3.14), p < 0.001; I2 =74.98%).

METHODOLOGY: One thousand working professionals who worked from home participated in the online survey with semi-structured questionnaire using nonprobability Snowball sampling technique. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze the findings and to collect data method. RESULTS: Participants were asked about their biggest worries during lockdown COVID-19 situation and their biggest worry was infection to COVID-19/death. Professionals were asked whether they were affected or not affected due to “WFH” in COVID situation. The questionnaire items were clubbed into six major categories of job role overload, lifestyle choices, family distraction, occupational discomfort, job performance, and distress, and majority categories were affected. CONCLUSION: Thus, it is observed that the increase in work commitments leads to distress among employees while distractions from family members disrupt the quality of work. While good job performance contributes to life satisfaction, distress significantly diminished it.

A plethora of optimal strategies has been recently developed to minimize either the infected peak prevalence (IPP) or the epidemic final size (EFS). While most of the control strategies optimize a simple cost function along a fixed finite-time horizon, no consensus has been reached about how to simultaneously handle the IPP, the EFS, and the avoiding of new cycles of infections rebounding. In this work, based on the characterization of the dynamical behaviour of SIR-type models under control actions (including the stability of equilibrium sets, in terms of the herd immunity), it is studied how to minimize the EFS while keeping - at any time - the IPP controlled.

These dietary behaviours may track into adulthood and lead to weight gain, obesity and related non-communicable diseases. While social media use in adolescents has proliferated, little is known about the content of food marketing within these platforms, and how this impacts adolescents' dietary behaviours. This paper aimed to obtain expert insights on factors involved in the association between social media food marketing (SMFM) and adolescent dietary behaviours, and to explore their views on key priorities, challenges and strategies for future SMFM research and policies. One-on-one semi-structured interviews (n = 17) were conducted with experts from Western Europe, Australia and North America, in the fields of public health (policy), nutrition science, social media marketing, adolescent medicine, clinical psychology, behavioural sciences, communication, food industry, social influencing, and social marketing. The experts' collective responses identified that the line between food content posted by social media users and food companies is blurred. Adolescents' processing of SMFM may be mostly implicit, involving social comparison, emotional engagement, and attaching symbolic meanings to foods. Mediating factors and adolescent-specific and SMFM-specific moderating factors potentially influencing adolescents' response to SMFM were summarized in a Social Ecological model. Experts agreed that there is limited scientific evidence on adolescent-targeted SMFM and there are no strict regulations in place to protect adolescents from unhealthy SMFM, while adolescents are active social media users who are cognitively vulnerable to implicit marketing tactics. Adolescent-targeted SMFM should be controlled by encouraging healthy food marketing or limiting junk food marketing. Also, prioritizing both quantitative research on SMFM exposure and its impact, and qualitative research to obtain adolescents' perspectives, is crucial to advocate for regulatory changes regarding adolescent-targeted SMFM content.",2021-09-09,"van der Bend, Daphne L M; Jakstas, Tammie; van Kleef, Ellen; Shrewsbury, Vanessa A; Bucher, Tamara",Appetite,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105691; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34509544/,237459622.0,2021,282

After analyzing the application and development of AI, it is introduced into sports and applied to table tennis competitions and training. The principle of the trajectory prediction of the table tennis ball (TTB) based on AI is briefly introduced. It is found that the difficulty of predicting TTB trajectories lies in rotation measurement. Accordingly, the rotation and trajectory of TTB are predicted using some AI algorithms. Specifically, a TTB detection algorithm is designed based on the Feature Fusion Network (FFN). For feature exaction, the cross-layer connection network is used to strengthen the learning ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and streamline network parameters to improve the network detection response. The experimental results demonstrate that the trained CNN can reach a detection accuracy of over 98%, with a detection response within 5.3 ms, meeting the requirements of the robot vision system of the table tennis robot. By comparison, the traditional Color Segmentation Algorithm has advantages in detection response, with unsatisfactory detection accuracy, especially against TTB's color changes. Thus, the algorithm reported here can immediately hit the ball with high accuracy.

Kidney transplantation is considered the definitive management of CKF. It has substantial benefits, including increased patient survival, improved skeletal growth, social adjustment, neuropsychological development, and better quality of life compared to chronic dialysis. METHODS This is a retrospective, clinical, observational study in 13 children ≤16 years old who underwent kidney transplantation at IALCH in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, from May 2015 to December 2019. RESULTS Over 4 years and 7 months, 13 kidney transplants were performed; 7 (53.8%) were males, and 6 (46.2%) were females. Eleven (84.6%) were Black African and 2 (15.4%) Indian children. The mean age ± (SD) of transplantation was 10.1 ± 2.8 years (range 5.8-15.8). Eight (61.5%) children were from a rural setting. The mean ± (SD) duration of follow-up was 29.5 ± 15.9 months. All kidney transplants done were from live related donors; 8 (61.5%) were parents of the recipients. None were pre-emptive transplants. Graft loss occurred in 2 (15.4%) children with 100% patient survival. Two (15.4%) children developed acute rejection. CONCLUSIONS The commissioning of transplant services in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, has improved access to this modality of treatment, particularly in our Black African patients.

Structured telephone interviews were administered to assess depressive symptoms, self-rated medical care provision, attitudes and social and emotional aspects of the pandemic (social support, perceived stress, loneliness, resilience, and agreeableness). RESULTS: A total of N = 106 people completed the telephone interview. The most frequent clinician-rated diagnoses were attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD; n = 29, 27.4%) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD; n = 24, 22.6%). The mean Patient Health Questionnaire-9 sum score was 10.91 (SD = 5.71) and the majority of participants (n = 56, 52.8%) reported clinically relevant depressive symptoms. A low self-rated medical care provision was significantly associated with higher depressive symptom load. In a regression analysis, higher perceived stress levels and low medical care provision significantly predicted depressive symptoms. Furthermore, 38.1% (n = 40) reported to feel relieved as a result of the restrictions and, due to previous experience in dealing with crisis, half of the participants (n = 53, 50.5%) stated they were better able to deal with the current situation than the general population. CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the importance of maintenance of medical care provision for people with mental disorders, as cancelled or postponed treatment appointments and perceived stress were associated with higher depressive symptoms. Regular treatment services showed to have a protective effect. In addition, a majority of people with mental disorders felt prepared for managing the COVID pandemic due to existing crisis management abilities. These resources should also be taken into account for further future treatment considerations.

Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have been the predominant method of accomplishing this, but their associated costs and complex design can limit their wide adoption. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced programs to identify unique ways to still provide authentic research experiences while students were virtual. We report here a complete guide for the successful implementation of a semester-long virtual CURE that uses Drosophila behavioral assays to explore the connection between pain and addiction with the use of an at-home “lab-in-a-box.” Individual components were piloted across three semesters and launched as a 100-level introductory course with 19 students. We found that this course increased science identity and successfully improved key research competencies as per the Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA) survey. This course is ideal for flipped classrooms ranging from introductory to upper-level biology/neuroscience courses and can be integrated directly into the lecture period without the need for building a new course.

METHODS: In this unmatched (1:2) case-control validation study, we used sera of 181 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases and 326 controls collected before SARS-CoV-2 emergence. Diagnostic accuracy of the immunoassay was assessed against a whole spike protein-based recombinant immunofluorescence assay (rIFA) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Discrepant cases between ELISA and rIFA were further tested by pseudo-neutralization assay. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients were more likely to be male and older than controls, and 50.3% were hospitalized. ROC curve analyses indicated that IgG and IgA had high diagnostic accuracies with AUCs of 0.990 (95% Confidence Interval [95%CI]: 0.983-0.996) and 0.978 (95%CI: 0.967-0.989), respectively. IgG assays outperformed IgA assays (p=0.01). Taking an assessed 15% inter-assay imprecision into account, an optimized IgG ratio cut-off > 2.5 displayed a 100% specificity (95%CI: 99-100) and a 100% positive predictive value (95%CI: 96-100). A 0.8 cut-off displayed a 94% sensitivity (95%CI: 88-97) and a 97% negative predictive value (95%CI: 95-99). Substituting the upper threshold for the manufacturer’s, improved assay performance, leaving 8.9% of IgG ratios indeterminate between 0.8-2.5. CONCLUSIONS: The Euroimmun assay displays a nearly optimal diagnostic accuracy using IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples, with no obvious gains from IgA serology. The optimized cut-offs are fit for rule-in and rule-out purposes, allowing determination of whether individuals in our study population have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or not.

Ethiopia has become one of the affected countries as of March 15, 2020. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the knowledge, perceptions, and practices among the Jimma University medical center (JUMC) visitors in Jimma town. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 247 sampled visitors, from 20–24 March 2020. Consecutive sampling was used to recruit the participants. The study tools were adapted from WHO resources. The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the status of knowledge, perception, and practices. Logistic regression was executed to assess the predictors of dominant preventive practices. RESULTS: Of the 247 respondents, 205 (83.0%) knew the main clinical symptoms of COVID-19. 72.0% knew that older people who have chronic illnesses are at high risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19. About 95.1% knew that the COVID-19 virus spreads via respiratory droplets of infected people, while 77 (31.2%) of the respondents knew about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission. Only 15 (6.1%) knew that children and young adults had to involve preventive measures. Overall, 41.3% of the visitors had high knowledge.

There are significantly more cases of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in European countries than in East Asia, where the disease was first detected. Such population differences are unique, especially for SARS-CoV-2 and are due to both socio-behavioral differences and features of the gene pool of the population of different countries. For infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, an important point is the genetic characteristics of individuals, which can determine its resistance or susceptibility to infection. Therefore, studies of the factors of hereditary predisposition to SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as severity and mortality are extremely relevant. After genotyping among the healthy population of Ukraine and collecting relevant data from some European countries, we determined the correlation between morbidity, mortality from COVID-19 and the prevalence of genotype II (ACE1, I/D polymorphism) in the populations of Ukraine and several European countries. There was a negative correlation between the carrier of genotype II and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection per one million population (R = –0.53, p < 0.05), so individuals with genotype II can be considered more resistant to infection SARS-CoV-2.

We tested the extraversion hypothesis, which suggests that the sociability facet of extraversion may predispose people to becoming infected with the coronavirus via greater human-to-human contact. Since extraverts seek out social opportunities and seem less likely to follow containment measures related to social distancing, we hypothesized that people who have previously become infected would exhibit greater extraversion than would those who have not contracted the virus. We measured overall extraversion and three of its facets–sociability, assertiveness, and energy levels–as well as political orientation.

This phenomenon has sharpened long-standing questions about the reliability of information shared prior to journal peer review. Does the information shared in preprints typically withstand the scrutiny of peer review, or are conclusions likely to change in the version of record? We assessed preprints from bioRxiv and medRxiv that had been posted and subsequently published in a journal through April 30, 2020, representing the initial phase of the pandemic response. We utilised a combination of automatic and manual annotations to quantify how an article changed between the preprinted and published version. We found that the total number of figure panels and tables changed little between preprint and published articles.

Prone position (PP) is an effective treatment for acute respiratory failure, which may improve the gas exchange of the injured lung and the patient's survival. PP is reported to improve the respiratory condition after cardiac surgery. However, limited data exist on the effect of PP in patients who underwent acute TAAD surgery. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcomes of seven patients with severe hypoxemia who underwent PP after acute TAAD surgery. The results of arterial blood gas, chest X-ray, and survival were collected. RESULTS Seven patients (3 female, mean age 48.3±11.7 years) were recruited in this study. All patients received total arch replacement and frozen elephant trunk implantation procedure. The PaO2 at day 1 after PP was higher than before PP (126.3±49.3 vs. 77.8±15.5 mmHg). The oxygenation index rose sharply from 83.0 (80.0, 87.0) to 188.3±56.5 at day 3 after PP. There was no significant difference in heart rate between before and after PP procedure. Chest X-ray showed the diffuse shadow was significantly improved after PP. All patients responded well to PP, and all patients were discharged except for one patient, who died perioperatively due to multiple organ failure.

For antiviral therapeutics, drug repurposing allowed for rapid movement of existing clinical candidates and therapies into human clinical trials to be tested as COVID-19 therapies. One effective antiviral treatment strategy used early in symptom onset is to prevent viral entry. SARS-CoV-2 enters ACE2-expressing cells when the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 followed by cleavage at two cut sites on the spike protein. TMPRSS2 has a protease domain capable of cleaving the two cut sites; therefore, a molecule capable of inhibiting the protease activity of TMPRSS2 could be a valuable antiviral therapy. Initially, we used a fluorogenic high-throughput screening assay for the biochemical screening of 6030 compounds in NCATS annotated libraries. Then, we developed an orthogonal biochemical assay that uses mass spectrometry detection of product formation to ensure that hits from the primary screen are not assay artifacts from the fluorescent detection of product formation. Finally, we assessed the hits from the biochemical screening in a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped particle entry assay. Of the six molecules advanced for further studies, two are approved drugs in Japan (camostat and nafamostat), two have entered clinical trials (PCI-27483 and otamixaban), while the other two molecules are peptidomimetic inhibitors of TMPRSS2 taken from the literature that have not advanced into clinical trials (compounds 92 and 114).

RESULTS: To enhance the immune efficiency of CEA in mice that received, we fused a partial CEA gene with exogenous SARS-CoV fragments. Oral vaccination of an attenuated Salmonella typhimurium strain transformed with plasmids encoding CEA-SARS-CoV fusion gene into BALB/c mice elicited significant increases in TNF-α and IL-10 in the serum. In addition, a smaller tumor volume was observed in CT26/CEA-bearing mice who received CEA-SARS-CoV gene therapy in comparison with those administered CEA alone.

The identification of effective strategies capable of reducing the case mortality rate of high-risk COVID-19 is an urgent and unmet medical need. We recently reported the clinical safety profile of RJX, a well-defined intravenous GMP-grade pharmaceutical formulation of anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory vitamins as active ingredients, in a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03680105) (Uckun et al., Front. Pharmacol. 11, 594321. 10.3389/fphar.2020.594321). Here we report data from a pilot clinical study (RPI-015) which examined the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of using RJX in combination with clinical standard of care (SOC) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with pneumonia (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04708340). In addition to our early clinical proof of concept (POC) data, we also present non-clinical POC from a mouse model of CRS and ARDS that informed the design of the reported clinical study. Methods. 13 patients, who were hospitalized with COVID-19 pneumonia and abnormally elevated serum inflammatory biomarkers markers [≥]3 months prior to the identification of the first confirmed U.S case of the Omicron variant, were treated with IV RJX (daily x 7 days) plus SOC. Non-clinical POC study examined the ability of RJX plus dexamethasone (DEX) to improve the survival outcome in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-Galactosamine (GalN) mouse model of fatal cytokine release syndrome (CRS), sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Findings. In the Phase 1 clinical study, none of the 13 patients developed a treatment-related DLT, SAE, or Grade 3-5 AEs. Nine (9) of the 12 evaluable patients, including 3 patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure, showed rapid clinical recovery. In the non-clinical POC study in LPS-GalN challenged mice, the combination of RJX plus DEX was more effective than RJX alone or DEX alone, reversed the CRS as well as inflammatory tissue damage in the lungs and liver, and improved the survival outcome. Taken together, these findings provide the early clinical and non-clinical POC for the development of RJX as an adjunct to the SOC in the multi-modality management of high-risk COVID-19.",2022-02-18,"Uckun, F.; Saeed, M.; Awili, M.; Ozercan, I.; Qazi, S.; Lee, C.; Shibli, A.; Skolnick, A.; Prusmack, A.; Varon, J.; Barrera, C.; Orhan, C.; Volk, M.; Sahin, K.",,,document_parses/pdf_json/cb83b98ac92af17fffaf45e71fd0c8f43db1262b.json,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.02.12.22270748v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.12.22270748,246941426.0,2022,325

All three experiments shared the same procedure but differed in the number of faces presented. Participants were presented with own-race and other-race faces, each followed by a remember or forget memory instruction, and subsequently received a recognition test for all studied faces. We obtained a robust cross-race effect (CRE) but did not find a DF effect in Experiment 1.

METHODS: We compared clinical characteristics in an age- and gender-matched sample of 75 deceased and 75 recovered patients (M(Age) = 78) hospitalized with COVID-19 and developed a logistic regression to predict likelihood of survival. RESULTS: Deceased patients were more like to have dementia, altered mental status (AMS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, mechanical ventilation, and balance difficulties; higher heart rate, respiratory rate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and absolute neutrophils; lower oxygen saturation and absolute lymphocytes; and shorter length of hospitalization. Logistic regression based on three mortality predictors (ARDS, AMS, and length of hospitalization) correctly predicted 87% of the outcome (89% sensitivity at 85% specificity). CONCLUSIONS: Dementia and AMS were strong predictors of death in older adults hospitalized with COVID-19.

However, there is a dearth of data describing the impact of COVID-19 infection in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis (ESRD-HD). Methods This retrospective case series analyzed 362 adult patients consecutively hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 illness between March 12, 2020 and May 13, 2020, at a teaching hospital in the New York City metropolitan area. Primary outcome was severe pneumonia as defined by the World Health Organization. Secondary outcomes were: 1) the Combined Outcome of Acute respiratory distress syndrome or in-hospital Death (COAD), and 2) the need for High-levels of Oxygen supplementation (HiO2). Results Patients with ESRD-HD had lower odds for poor outcomes including severe pneumonia [Odds Ratio (OR) 0.4, Confidence Interval (CI) (0.2-0.9) p=.04], HiO2 [OR 0.3, CI (0.1-0.8) p=.02] and COAD [OR 0.4, CI (0.2-1.05) p=.06], when compared to patients without ESRD. In contrast, higher odds for severe pneumonia, COAD and HiO2 were seen with advancing age. African-Americans were over-represented in the hospitalized patient cohort, when compared to their representation in the community (35% vs 18%). Hispanics had higher odds for severe-illness and HiO2 when compared to Caucasians. Conclusions Patients with ESRD-HD had a milder course of illness with a lower likelihood of severe pneumonia and a lesser need for aggressive oxygen supplementation when compared to patients not on chronic dialysis.

Moreover, the effect of Adam17 deletion in an in vitro 3D cell culture from human proximal tubular cells under high glucose conditions was evaluated. eAdam17 deletion attenuates renal fibrosis and inflammation, whereas tAdam17 deletion decreases podocyte loss, attenuates the RAS, and decreases macrophage infiltration, α-SMA and collagen accumulation. The 3D in vitro cell culture reinforced the findings obtained in tAdam17KO mice with decreased fibrosis in the Adam17 knockout spheroids.

Hip fracture fixation in this class of patients is considered a high-risk procedure. Preoperative physical examination, plasma natriuretic peptide levels (BNP, Pro-BNP), and cardiovascular scoring systems (ASA-PS, RCRI, NSQIP-MICA) have all been demonstrated to underestimate the risk of postoperative complications. We designed a prospective multicenter observational study to assess whether preoperative lung ultrasound examination can predict better postoperative events thanks to the additional information they provide in the form of “indirect” and “direct” cardiac and pulmonary lung ultrasound signs. METHODS: LUSHIP is an Italian multicenter prospective observational study. Patients will be recruited on a nation-wide scale in the 12 participating centers. Patients aged > 65 years undergoing spinal anesthesia for hip fracture fixation will be enrolled. A lung ultrasound score (LUS) will be generated based on the examination of six areas of each lung and ascribing to each area one of the four recognized aeration patterns—each of which is assigned a subscore of 0, 1, 2, or 3. Thus, the total score will have the potential to range from a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 36. The association between 30-day postoperative complications of cardiac and/or pulmonary origin and the overall mortality will be studied. Considering the fact that cardiac complications in patients undergoing hip surgery occur in approx. 30% of cases, to achieve 80% statistical power, we will need a sample size of 877 patients considering a relative risk of 1.5. CONCLUSIONS: Lung ultrasound (LU), as a tool within the anesthesiologist’s armamentarium, is becoming increasingly widespread, and its use in the preoperative setting is also starting to become more common. Should the study demonstrate the ability of LU to predict postoperative cardiac and pulmonary complications in hip fracture patients, a randomized clinical trial will be designed with the scope of improving patient outcome.

In the telencephalic neuroepithelium, this is controlled in part by cell adhesion molecules and regulators of progenitor cell lineage, but the specific orchestration of these processes remains unknown. Here, we studied the role of microRNAs in the embryonic telencephalon as key regulators of gene expression. By using the early recombiner Rx-Cre mouse, we identify novel and critical roles of miRNAs in early brain development, demonstrating they are essential to preserve the cellular homeostasis and structural integrity of the telencephalic neuroepithelium. We show that Rx-Cre;DicerF/F mouse embryos have a severe disruption of the telencephalic apical junction belt, followed by invagination of the ventricular surface and formation of hyperproliferative rosettes. Transcriptome analyses and functional experiments in vivo show that these defects result from upregulation of Irs2 upon loss of let-7 miRNAs in an apoptosis-independent manner.

Unfortunately, evidence indicates that immunity wanes following vaccination, especially with the Delta variant (B.1.617.2). Protection against severe disease and death remain high, but protection against milder disease and infection have dropped significantly. A third booster dose of two-dose vaccines has been approved in several countries to individuals at higher risk of severe disease to protect those individuals, but the benefit to boosting immunity in younger healthy individuals and the effects on transmission are less clear. Methods Here we use relationships between neutralizing antibody titers and vaccine protection against infection and transmission, combined with data on waning and boosting of neutralizing antibody titers to examine the impact of a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine on infection and transmission and its impact on the pathogen effective reproductive number Rt. Findings Eight months of waning reduced protection of the Pfizer vaccine against all infections from 80.0% (95% CI: 77% to 83%) to 60.4% (95% CI: 53% to 67%); a third dose (which increased neutralizing antibody titers 25.9- fold relative to levels after 8 months of waning) increased protection to 87.2% (95% CI: 83% to 91%). Increased protection against infection and transmission from third doses reduced Rt by 21% to 66% depending on vaccine coverage and previous infection and reduced Rt below 1 when vaccination coverage was high or contact rates were well below pre-pandemic levels. Interpretation A third dose of the Pfizer vaccine could reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which would reduce infection in unvaccinated individuals and breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. While vaccination of unvaccinated individuals, especially in developing countries, would be more effective for reducing disease than providing a third dose to vaccinated individuals, the benefit of a third dose in reducing transmission is sizeable and increases with vaccine coverage and contact rates among individuals.",2021-10-26,"Gardner, B.

Methods: Influenza and COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among children <18 years old were analyzed from FluSurv-NET and COVID-NET, two population-based surveillance systems with similar catchment areas and methodology. The annual COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate per 100 000 during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (October 1, 2020-September 30, 2021) was compared to influenza-associated hospitalization rates during the 2017-18 through 2019-20 influenza seasons. In-hospital outcomes, including intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death, were compared. Results: Among children <18 years old, the COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate (48.2) was higher than influenza-associated hospitalization rates: 2017-18 (33.5), 2018-19 (33.8), and 2019-20 (41.7).

These include elective surgical services due to the synergetic resources required to provide both perioperative surgical care whilst also treating acute COVID‐19 patients and also the poor outcomes associated with surgical patients who develop COVID‐19 in the perioperative period. This article discusses the important principles and concepts for providing important surgical services during the COVID‐19 pandemic based on the model of the RMCancerSurgHub which is providing surgical cancer services for a population of approximately 2 million people across London during the pandemic. The model focusses on creating local and regional hub centres which provide urgent treatment for surgical patients in an environment that is relatively protected from the burden of COVID‐19 illness. The model extensively utilises the extended multidisciplinary team to allow for a flexible approach with core services delivered in ‘clean’ sites which can adapt to viral surges. A key requirement is that of a clinical prioritisation process which allows for equity in access within and between specialties ensuring that patients are treated on the basis of greatest need, while at the same time protecting those whose conditions can safely wait from exposure to the virus. Importantly, this model has the ability to scale‐up activity and lead units and networks into the recovery phase.

Areas covered: A recent strategy in antiviral research is based on the identification of molecules targeting host functions required for infection of multiple viruses. A number of FDA-approved drugs used to treat several human diseases are cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs) that have the ability to accumulate inside cells affecting several structures/functions hijacked by viruses during infection. In this review we summarized the CADs’ chemical properties and effects on the cells and reported the main FDA-approved CADs that have been identified so far as potential antivirals in drug repurposing studies. Expert commentary: Although there have been concerns regarding the efficacy and the possible side effects of the off-label use of CADs as antivirals, they seem to represent a promising starting point for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral strategies.

Supplier selection, environmental effects such as social cooperation, and other SSCM programmes, can all help to achieve the “triple bottom line (TBL)” of economic, environmental, and social advantages. Sustainable supplier selection (SSS) and firm performance are important factors in supply chain management (SCM). Organizations will traditionally consider a new framework when evaluating SSS performance to obtain all-encompassing criteria/sub-criteria of the sustainability index by encapsulating sustainability. This paper compiles 12 subcriteria for three sustainability pillars, namely economic, environmental, and social performance. Despite the fact that many articles on SSS and evaluation were published during COVID-19, there seems to be little research on sustainability issues to date. The goal of this study is to suggest a fuzzy multicriteria approach to SSCM planning. Additionally, using the TBL method, the problem of determining a current model for SSS in the supply chain was investigated. The linguistic value of the subjective preference of experts is represented by triangular fuzzy numbers. Fuzzy TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) is proposed to use standard weights to rank SSS for qualitative performance evaluation. COVID-19, on the other hand, has a detrimental impact on SSS and company results. The organization’s performance suffers as a result of the COVID-19 shutdown.

METHODS: Volume of emergency stroke code activations, patient characteristics, stroke severity, reperfusion rates, treatment times, and outcomes from February 1 to April 30, 2020, were compared against the same time period in 2019. Demographic data were provided by each participating institution. RESULTS: There was a 17.3% decrease in stroke code activations across LAC in 2020 compared to 2019 (1,786 vs. 2,159, respectively, χ2 goodness of fit test p < 0.0001) across 9 participating comprehensive stroke centers. Patients who did not receive any reperfusion therapy decreased by 16.6% in 2020 (1,527) compared to 2019 (1,832). Patients who received only intravenous thrombolytic (IVT) therapy decreased by 31.8% (107 vs. 157). Patients who received only mechanical thrombectomy (MT) increased by 3% (102 vs. 99). Patients who received both IVT and MT decreased by 31.8% (45 vs. 66). Recanalization treatment times in 2020 were comparable to 2019. CSCs serving a higher proportion of Latinx populations in the eastern parts of LAC experienced a higher incidence of MT in 2020 compared to 2019. Mild increase in stroke severity was seen in 2020 compared to 2019 (8.95 vs. 8.23, p = 0.046). A higher percentage of patients were discharged home in 2020 compared to 2019 (59.5 vs. 56.1%, p = 0.034), a lower percentage of patients were discharged to skilled nursing facility (16.1 vs. 20.7%, p = 0.0004), and a higher percentage of patients expired (8.6 vs. 6.3%, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: LAC saw a decrease in overall stroke code activations in 2020 compared to 2019. Reperfusion treatment times remained comparable to prepandemic metrics. There has been an increase in severe stroke incidence and higher volume of thrombectomy treatments in Latinx communities within LAC during the pandemic of 2020.

Different studies have displayed an existing association between pregnancy and COVID-19 severity due to the various physiological changes that occur during gestation. Recent data identified maternal country of origin as an important determinant of COVID-19 presentation in pregnant women. However, the explanation of this fact remains to be fully elucidated. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to analyze the possible relationship between Human Development Index (HDI) of maternal country of origin with the morbimortality of pregnant women and their newborns. Here, we conducted a multicentric, ambispective, observational case-control study (1:1 ratio) and compare with the HDI of each country (group 1—very high HDI, group 2—high HDI, group 3—medium HDI, and group 4—low HDI). In total, 1347 pregnant women with confirmed SARV-CoV-2 infection (cases) were enrolled, and each was paired with one control to give a total number of 2694 participants from 81 tertiary care centers. Among the women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, more cases were produced of perinatal mortality, overall maternal morbidity, COVID-19 maternal morbidity, C-sections, hypertensive maternal morbidity, and perinatal morbidity. Our results described an inverse association between HDI and maternofetal morbidity and mortality. Moreover, the countries with an HDI lower than 1 showed higher rates of patients with maternal COVID-19-related morbidity (6.0% vs. 2.4%, p < 0.001), a need for oxygen therapy (4.7% vs. 1.8%, p < 0.001), and maternal ICU admission (2.6% vs. 1.0%, p = 0.007). Compared to other risk factors such as overweight, obesity, preexisting and obstetric comorbidities, HDI emerged as an independent risk factor explaining much of the increased maternal–perinatal morbidity and mortality detected in our group of cases.

We used World Bank data on country wealth from OECD data on social benefits for families and public income support to SPH. Multilevel linear regressions assessed mediated (indirect) associations of these country-level predictors, through SEP, with life satisfaction. Family social benefits ranged between 1.1% and 3.7% of country wealth.

In this study, transcriptome analysis was used to infer mechanisms activated during barrage formation in vic3-incompatible strains of Cryphonectria parasitica, the chestnut blight fungus. Pronounced differential expression occurred in barraging strains of genes involved in mating pheromone (mf2-1, mf2-2), secondary metabolite production, detoxification (including oxidative stress), apoptosis-related, RNA interference, and HET-domain genes. Evidence for secondary metabolite production and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation is supported through UPLC-HRMS analysis and cytological staining, respectively. Differential expression of mating-related genes and HET-domain genes was further examined by RT-qPCR of incompatible interactions involving each of the six vegetative incompatibility (vic) loci in C. parasitica and revealed distinct recognition process networks. We infer that vegetative incompatibility in C. parasitica activates defence reactions that involve secondary metabolism, resulting in increased toxicity of the extra- and intracellular environment. Accumulation of ROS (and other potential toxins) may result in detoxification failure and activation of apoptosis, sporulation, and the expression of associated pheromone genes.

Cervical cancer growth is related to human papillomavirus (HPV) contamination. Early screening made cervical cancer a preventable disease that results in minimizing the global burden of cervical cancer. In developing countries, women do not approach sufficient screening programs because of the costly procedures to undergo examination regularly, scarce awareness, and lack of access to the medical center. In this manner, the expectation of the individual patient's risk becomes very high. There are many risk factors relevant to malignant cervical formation. This paper proposes an approach named CervDetect that uses machine learning algorithms to evaluate the risk elements of malignant cervical formation. CervDetect uses Pearson correlation between input variables as well as with the output variable to pre-process the data. CervDetect uses the random forest (RF) feature selection technique to select significant features. Finally, CervDetect uses a hybrid approach by combining RF and shallow neural networks to detect Cervical Cancer. Results show that CervDetect accurately predicts cervical cancer, outperforms the state-of-the-art studies, and achieved an accuracy of 93.6%, mean squared error (MSE) error of 0.07111, false-positive rate (FPR) of 6.4%, and false-negative rate (FNR) of 100%.",2021-12-23,"Mehmood, Mavra; Rizwan, Muhammad; Gregus ml, Michal; Abbas, Sidra",Front Public Health,,document_parses/pdf_json/e792132247deb51f92367929953a5ddea9e83230.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35004588/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.788376,245387489.0,2021,202

Results: Fever (62.6%) and cough (47.9%) were the most prevalent symptoms among children with suspected COVID-19 infection. Compared to children with a negative COVID-19 test, children who tested positive had higher prevalence of myalgia (21.7% vs 6.0%) and loss of taste/smell (15.2% vs 0.9%). Over half of the children who tested positive for COVID-19 had public insurance (52.2%) and 58.7% of the positive tests occurred among children with Hispanic ethnicity. Conclusions: Myalgia and loss of taste/smell were found to be significantly more prevalent among COVID-19 positive children compared to children testing negative. Additionally, children with public insurance and those with Hispanic ethnicity were more likely to test positive, emphasizing the importance of social factors in the screening and decision-making process.",2022-05-05,"Satoskar, S.; Hindman, D.; Husain, A.; Prichett, L.; Badaki, O.; Kane, A.",,,document_parses/pdf_json/b67991aca610db798ba6ed270c6da69b92c6e9bb.json,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.05.03.22274641v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.03.22274641,248524129.0,2022,249

(Brassicaceae), which is commonly known as woad, is a species with an ancient and well-documented history as an indigo dye and medicinal plant. Currently, I. tinctoria is utilized more often as medicinal remedy and also as a cosmetic ingredient. In 2011, I. tinctoria root was accepted in the official European phytotherapy by introducing its monograph in the European Pharmacopoeia. The biological properties of raw material have been known from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Over recent decades, I. tinctoria has been investigated both from a phytochemical and a biological point of view. The modern in vitro and in vivo scientific studies proved anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, antimicrobial, antiviral, analgesic, and antioxidant activities. The phytochemical composition of I. tinctoria has been thoroughly investigated and the plant was proven to contain many valuable biologically active compounds, including several alkaloids, among which tryptanthrin, indirubin, indolinone, phenolic compounds, and polysaccharides as well as glucosinolates, carotenoids, volatile constituents, and fatty acids. This article provides a general botanical and ethnobotanical overview that summarizes the up-to-date knowledge on the phytochemistry and biological properties of this valuable plant in order to support its therapeutic potential. Moreover, the biotechnological studies on I. tinctoria, which mainly focused on hairy root cultures for the enhanced production of flavonoids and alkaloids as well as on the establishment of shoot cultures and micropropagation protocols, were reviewed.

A diagnosis of SNA is frequently delayed due to the scarcity of symptoms in its early stages, leading to significant neurological deterioration. Therefore, prompt suspicion of the disease is critical to providing better outcomes. This case assembles two rare characteristics of SNA: diabetic aetiology and a precocious time of diagnosis, and aims to highlight the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings that allowed for the diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 44-year-old woman, with long-term type 1 diabetes, presented with a two-month history of progressive lumbar pain, difficulty in maintaining an upright position, and discrete trunk forward-leaning. Diabetes-related vasculopathy and nephropathy were already known, and laboratory test results did not show any new abnormalities. A lumbar MRI revealed extensive signal intensity changes of the L2 and L3 vertebral bodies associated with marginal areas of enhancement and the involvement of regions adjacent to interapophyseal articulations and spinous processes from L2–L3 to L5–S1, in association with degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine. These findings were identified by the radiologist as suggestive of SNA. To rule out neoplastic and infectious disease, a bone biopsy at the L2–L3 level was executed. The pathology report revealed intervertebral disc material and fragments of fibrous tissue, with a complete absence of inflammatory cells. It was decided to perform a six-month MRI follow-up, which showed stability of the findings, confirming the hypothesis of Charcot spine. The patient was under clinical and radiological follow-up and did not require surgical fixation at the moment of diagnosis. After 2.5 years from the initial diagnosis, a new MRI revealed progression of the lesions with oedema and enlarged paravertebral soft tissues; these findings are compatible with the patient’s latest complaints of lumbar pain recurrence. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of an MRI-based early diagnosis of diabetic SNA, a rare disease with nonspecific symptoms in its initial stages and a wide spectrum of differential diagnoses. The MRI findings, distinctly the involvement of both anterior and posterior spinal elements, were the key to allowing for the proper diagnosis. A precocious diagnosis, although challenging, is fundamental to providing early intervention and to preventing further neurological impairment.",2021-05-19,"Nedel, Barbara Limberger; Duarte, Juliana Avila; Gerchman, Fernando",BMC Neurol,,document_parses/pdf_json/a4806c5380b695e4cb4cd6f4a6710f3758251c81.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34011317/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12883-021-02235-3,234774250.0,2021,380

Some viruses use specific packaging signals, which are conserved sequence/structure motifs present only in the full-length genome. Recent work has shown that viral proteins important for packaging can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), where one or two viral nucleic acid binding proteins condense with the genome. The compositional simplicity of viral components lends itself well to theoretical modeling compared to more complex cellular organelles. Viral LLPS can be limited to one or two viral proteins and a single genome that is enriched in LLPS-promoting features. In our previous study, we observed that LLPS-promoting sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are located at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genome, whereas the middle of the genome is predicted to consist mostly of solubilizing elements. Is this arrangement sufficient to drive single genome packaging, genome compaction, and genome cyclization? We addressed these questions using a coarse-grained polymer model, LASSI, to study the LLPS of nucleocapsid protein with RNA sequences that either promote LLPS or solubilization. With respect to genome cyclization, we find the most optimal arrangement restricts LLPS-promoting elements to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genome, consistent with the native spatial patterning. Genome compaction is enhanced by clustered LLPS-promoting binding sites, while single genome packaging is most efficient when binding sites are distributed throughout the genome. These results suggest that many and variably positioned LLPS-promoting signals can support packaging in the absence of a singular packaging signal which argues against necessity of such a feature. We hypothesize that this model should be generalizable to multiple viruses as well as cellular organelles like paraspeckles, which enrich specific, long RNA sequences in a defined arrangement.",2021-06-30,"Seim, Ian; Roden, Christine A.; Gladfelter, Amy S.",Biophys J,,document_parses/pdf_json/9e8f0df1322ea338d3ad0bd78cbe0dd9cb0ce765.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2021.06.018; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349521005051?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34214535/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006349521005051,235676486.0,2021,288

Unlike many other enveloped viruses, which possess homotrimeric spikes, the spike responsible for cellular tropism in Arteriviruses is a heterotrimer composed of 3 glycoproteins: GP2, GP3, and GP4. Together with the hydrophobic protein E they are the minor components of virus particles. We describe the expression of all 3 minor glycoproteins, each equipped with a different tag, from a multi-cassette system in mammalian BHK-21 cells. Coprecipitation studies suggest that a rather small faction of GP2, GP3, and GP4 form dimeric or trimeric complexes. GP2, GP3, and GP4 co-localize with each other and also, albeit weaker, with the E-protein. The co-localization of GP3-HA and GP2-myc was tested with markers for ER, ERGIC, and cis-Golgi. The co-localization of GP3-HA was the same regardless of whether it was expressed alone or as a complex, whereas the transport of GP2-myc to cis-Golgi was higher when this protein was expressed as a complex. The glycosylation pattern was also independent of whether the proteins were expressed alone or together.

Native myocardial T1 times are prolonged in patients requiring dialysis, but there are concerns that the dialysis process and fluctuating fluid status may confound results in this population. We aimed to assess the changes in cardiac parameters on 3T cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) before and after haemodialysis, with a specific focus on native T1 mapping. METHODS: This is a single centre, prospective observational study in which maintenance haemodialysis patients underwent CMR before and after dialysis (both scans within 24 h). Weight measurement, bio-impedance body composition monitoring, haemodialysis details and fluid intake were recorded. CMR protocol included cine imaging and mapping native T1 and T2. RESULTS: Twenty-six participants (16 male, 65 ± 9 years) were included in the analysis. The median net ultrafiltration volume on dialysis was 2.3 L (IQR 1.8, 2.5), resulting in a median weight reduction at post-dialysis scan of 1.35 kg (IQR 1.0, 1.9), with a median reduction in over-hydration (as measured by bioimpedance) of 0.75 L (IQR 0.5, 1.4). Significant reductions were observed in LV end-diastolic volume (− 25 ml, p = 0.002), LV stroke volume (− 13 ml, p = 0.007), global T1 (21 ms, p = 0.02), global T2 (− 1.2 ms, p = 0.02) following dialysis. There was no change in LV mass (p = 0.35), LV ejection fraction (p = 0.13) or global longitudinal strain (p = 0.22). On linear regression there was no association between baseline over-hydration (as defined by bioimpedance) and global native T1 or global T2, nor was there an association between the change in over-hydration and the change in these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Acute changes in cardiac volumes and myocardial native T1 are detectable on 3T CMR following haemodialysis with fluid removal. The reduction in global T1 suggests that the abnormal native T1 observed in patients on haemodialysis is not entirely due to myocardial fibrosis.

The objective function is expressed in terms of expectation operator over a sum of two terms satisfying a stochastic bounded gradient condition, with or without strong convexity type properties. In contrast to the classical approach, where the constraints are usually represented as intersection of simple sets, in this paper we consider that each constraint set is given as the level set of a convex but not necessarily differentiable function. Based on the flexibility offered by our general optimization model we consider a stochastic subgradient method with random feasibility updates. At each iteration, our algorithm takes a stochastic proximal (sub)gradient step aimed at minimizing the objective function and then a subsequent subgradient step minimizing the feasibility violation of the observed random constraint. We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm for diminishing stepsizes and for the case when the objective function is convex or has a quadratic functional growth, unifying the nonsmooth and smooth cases. We prove sublinear convergence rates for this stochastic subgradient algorithm, which are known to be optimal for subgradient methods on this class of problems. When the objective function has a linear least-square form and the constraints are polyhedral, it is shown that the algorithm converges linearly. Numerical evidence supports the effectiveness of our method in real problems.",2022-04-18,"Necoara, Ion; Singh, Nitesh Kumar",,,document_parses/pdf_json/a15ab5fcb5810f915d264d821083e15b4a85da8a.json,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08204v1.pdf,248227747.0,2022,231

The current existing techniques for the identification of S. agalactiae are limited by accuracy, speed and high-cost. Therefore, a new multiple cross displacement amplification (MCDA) assay was developed for test of the target pathogen immediately from vaginal and rectal swabs. MCDA primers screening were conducted targeting S. agalactiae pcsB gene, and one set of MCDA primers with better rapidity and efficiency was selected for establishing the S. agalactiae-MCDA assay. As a result, the MCDA method could be completed at a constant temperature of 61 °C, without the requirement of special equipment. The detection limit is 250 fg (31.5 copies) per reaction, all S. agalactiae strains displayed positive results, but not for non-S. agalactiae strains. The visual MCDA assay detected 16 positive samples from 200 clinical specimen, which were also detected positive by enrichment/qPCR. While the CHROMagar culture detected 6 positive samples. Thus, the MCDA assay is prefer to enrichment/qPCR and culture for detecting S. agalactiae from clinical specimen. Particularly, the whole test of MCDA takes about 63.1 min, including sample collection (3 min), DNA preparation (15 min), MCDA reaction (45 min) and result reporting (6 s). In addition, the cost was very economic, with only US$ 4.9. These results indicated that our S. agalaciae-MCDA assay is a rapid, sensitive and cost-efficient technique for target pathogen detection, and is more suitable than conventional assays for an urgent detection, especially for 'on-site' laboratories and resource-constrained settings.",2021-01-06,"Cheng, Xueqin; Dou, Zhiqian; Yang, Jing; Liu, Dexi; Gu, Yulong; Cai, Fenglin; Li, Xiaobing; Wang, Meifang; Tang, Yijun",AMB Express,,document_parses/pdf_json/558ec6fc9168fe8f5a1dad938ac535b36666738b.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33409835/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13568-020-01168-3,230818281.0,2021,250

To maximize the uptake and reach of this promising strategy and inform intervention development and scale up, research is needed to understand the acceptability of and willingness to use this tool. This is vital to ensure that Black/African Americans are reached by the Biden-Harris Administration’s free national COVID-19 ST program. This study aimed to explore the acceptability and recommendations to promote and scale up the uptake of COVID-19 ST among Black/African Americans. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional qualitative study using a semi-structured survey to assess barriers and facilitators to the uptake of COVID-19 ST among a convenience sample of 28 self-identified Black/African Americans from schools, community centers, and faith-based institutions in Ohio and Maryland. Inductive content analysis was conducted to identify categories and subcategories related to acceptability and recommendations for implementing and scaling up COVID-19 ST in communities. RESULTS: Participants perceived COVID-19 self-testing as an acceptable tool that is beneficial to prevent transmission and address some of the barriers associated with health facility testing, such as transportation cost and human contact at the health facility. However, concerns were raised regarding the accurate use of the kits and costs. Recommendations for implementing and scaling up COVID-19 ST included engagement of community stakeholders to disseminate information about COVID-19 self-testing and creating culturally appropriate education tools to promote knowledge of and clear instructions about how to properly use COVID-19 ST kits. Based on these recommendations, the COVID-19 STEP (Self-Testing Education and Promotion) Project is being developed and will involve engaging community partners such as barbers, church leaders, and other community-based organizations to increase the uptake and use of free COVID-19 ST kits among Black/African Americans. CONCLUSION: Findings showed that most participants considered COVID-19 ST valuable for encouraging COVID-19 testing. However, cost and accuracy concerns may pose barriers.

Western blotting analysis combined with N-glycanase digestion revealed that ORF 5 and ORF 6 proteins were similar in size to native VP-3 and M/VP-2, and that ORF 5 protein was N-glycosylated, like the native VP-3. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that both ORF 5 and ORF 6 proteins were distributed throughout the cytoplasm and were colocalized in most cells. Moreover, ORF 5 protein was localized both in the perinuclear region and the Golgi complex and transported to the cell surface.

In this work, gene co-expression networks were reconstructed from RNA-Seq expression data with the aim of analyzing the time-resolved effects of gene Ly6E in the immune response against the coronavirus responsible for murine hepatitis (MHV). Through the integration of differential expression analyses and reconstructed networks exploration, significant differences in the immune response to virus were observed in Ly6E [Formula: see text] compared to wild type animals. Results show that Ly6E ablation at hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) leads to a progressive impaired immune response in both liver and spleen. Specifically, depletion of the normal leukocyte mediated immunity and chemokine signaling is observed in the liver of Ly6E [Formula: see text] mice. On the other hand, the immune response in the spleen, which seemed to be mediated by an intense chromatin activity in the normal situation, is replaced by ECM remodeling in Ly6E [Formula: see text] mice.

We have developed a lead isoxazole-3-carboxamide analog of pleconaril (11526092) which displayed potent inhibition of the pleconaril-resistant CVB3-Woodruff (IC50 6-20 nM), EV-D68 (IC50 58 nM), and other enteroviruses. A mouse respiratory model of EV-D68 infection, in which pleconaril is inactive, showed decreased viremia of 3 log units as well as statistically significant 1 log reduction in lung titer reduction at day 5 after treatment with 11526092. A cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of EV-D68 in complex with 11526092 suggests that the increased potency may be due to additional hydrophobic interactions. Cryo-EM structures of 11526092 and pleconaril demonstrate destabilization of EV-D68 (MO strain) compared to the previously described stabilization of EV-D68 (Fermon strain) with pleconaril, illustrating clear strain dependent mechanisms of this molecule. 11526092 represents a more potent inhibitor in vitro with in vivo efficacy providing a potential future treatment for EV-D68 and AFM, suggesting an improvement over pleconaril for further optimization.

Recent statistics indicate that the majority of the cases are home-treated. Two drugs of interest, Guaifenesin and Bromohexine HCl, are among the add-on therapy for treatment of COVID-19 mild cases, which has raised the need for their simultaneous determination. The analysis of the two drugs of interest was described using ultra-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC–MS/MS) in plasma of healthy human volunteers using tetryzoline HCl as an internal standard (IS) after liquid–liquid extraction. The applied chromatographic conditions were Kinetex C(18) (100 Å, 2.6 µm X 50 mm X 4.6 mm) column and a mixture of methanol: water (95: 5, v/v) as a mobile phase at flow rate 1 mL/min.

Because of the life-threatening nature of this complication, we wanted to investigate the features of pericardial effusion and the rate of occurrence of tamponade in patients with COVID-19. Methods This systematic review was conducted by searching for studies in Pubmed/Medline and Google Scholar for the search terms ‘COVID-19’, ‘SARS-COV-2’, ‘Pericarditis’, ‘Pericardial Effusion’ and ‘Cardiac Tamponade’, performed on December 7, 2020. Results A total of 47 patients with COVID-19 with pericarditis were included in the review from 39 published cases. There were 29 (62%) males and 18 (38%) females and mean age of patients was 53 years. Pulmonary infiltrates were seen in 30 (64%) patients, while 17 (36%) patients did not have pulmonary manifestations. Concomitant myocarditis was present in 16 (34%) patients. 43 (91%) had pericardial effusion- 4 (9%) had small, 10 (21%) had moderate, 3 (6%) had a large pericardial effusion and 26 (55%) patients had cardiac tamponade. 7 (15%) patients with tamponade died. Pericardiocentesis was done in 27 (57%) patients and pericardial window was created in 5 (11%) patients. Off these 13 (27%) patients had an exudative effusion while 1 (2%) patient had a transudative effusion. Conclusion We found that pericarditis in patients with COVID-19 infection can be present in patients with pulmonary infiltrates and without them, as well as with myocarditis or as an isolated feature of cardiac involvement. The effusion is predominantly exudative. More than half of the patients with pericardial involvement present with tamponade, and mortality in this subset is high.

Recent cancer research is now utilizing the medicinal chemistry toolbox to tailor novel 'smart' carrier systems that can reduce the major limitations of chemotherapy ranging from non-specificity and ubiquitous biodistribution to systemic toxicity. In this aspect, various stimuli-responsive polymers have gained considerable interest due to their intrinsic tumor targeting properties. Among these polymers, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAM) has been chemically modified to tune its thermoresponsivity or even copolymerized to endow new stimulus responsiveness for enhancing tumor targeting. Herein, we set our design rationale to impart additional active targeting entity to pH/temperature-responsive PNIPAM-based polymer for more efficient controlled payloads accumulation at the tumor through cellular internalization via synthesizing novel ""super intelligent"" lactoferrin conjugated PNIPAM-acrylic acid (LF-PNIPAM-co-AA) copolymer. The synthesized copolymer was physicochemically characterized and evaluated as a smart nanocarrier for targeting breast cancer. In this regard, Honokiol (HK) was utilized as a model anticancer drug and encapsulated in the nanoparticles to overcome its lipophilic nature and allow its parenteral administration, for achieving sustainable drug release with targeting action. Results showed that the developed HK-loaded LF-PNIPAM-co-AA nanohydrogels displayed high drug loading capacity reaching to 18.65 wt.% with excellent physical and serum stability. Moreover, the prepared HK-loaded nanohydrogels exhibited efficient in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities. In vivo, HK-loaded nanohydrogels demonstrated suppression of VEGF-1 and Ki-67 expression levels, besides inducing apoptosis through upregulating the expression level of active caspase-3 in breast cancer-bearing mice.

Although increasing evidence suggests that metabolites produced by the human microbiome have diverse biological activities, their antiviral properties remain poorly explored. Using a cell-based SARS-CoV-2 infection assay, we screened culture broth extracts from a collection of phylogenetically diverse human-associated bacteria for the production of small molecules with antiviral activity. Bioassay-guided fractionation uncovered three bacterial metabolites capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection. This included the nucleoside analogue N(6)-(Δ(2)-isopentenyl)adenosine, the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonist tryptamine, and the pyrazine 2,5-bis(3-indolylmethyl)pyrazine. The most potent of these, N(6)-(Δ(2)-isopentenyl)adenosine, had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 2 μM. These natural antiviral compounds exhibit structural and functional similarities to synthetic drugs that have been clinically examined for use against COVID-19. Our discovery of structurally diverse metabolites with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity from screening a small fraction of the bacteria reported to be associated with the human microbiome suggests that continued exploration of phylogenetically diverse human-associated bacteria is likely to uncover additional small molecules that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viral infections. IMPORTANCE The continued prevalence of COVID-19 and the emergence of new variants has once again put the spotlight on the need for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. The human microbiome produces an array of small molecules with bioactivities (e.g., host receptor ligands), but its ability to produce antiviral small molecules is relatively underexplored.

SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, an airway disease that can be severe and fatal in a percentage of cases. Patients with severe COVID-19 can develop extrapulmonary lesions, with renal, hepatic, cardiac, neurological, and tissue involvement that can cause further severe complications. On December 21, 2021, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) authorized the marketing of the first COVID-19 vaccine. However, several randomized trials are ongoing to find effective, safe, and widely available treatments. The most severe stages of COVID-19 infection are characterized by a multi-system inflammatory state induced by a cytokine storm causing multi-organ injury. Epidemiologic evidence has shown that glucocorticoids (GCs), particularly dexamethasone, are used in severe, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 with good therapeutic benefit. COVID-19 can also damage the endothelial system, causing microcirculatory disturbances and consequently leading to functional organ disorders. The combination of endothelial dysfunction with a generalized inflammatory state may contribute to the general pro-coagulative state described in patients with COVID-19 with increased risk of venous and arterial occlusions. The aim of this article is to describe the therapeutic utility of GCs in stabilizing the vascular endothelial barrier in COVID-19 infection. Indeed, we believe that the stabilization of the endothelial barrier and the anti-inflammatory effect of GCs could be the main effect underlying the therapeutic efficacy in COVID-19 patients.",2021-01-14,"Ferrara, Francesco; Vitiello, Antonio",Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,,document_parses/pdf_json/be95b7b15633560c1a2f444272257ad52707b996.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33443616/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00210-021-02049-7,231603802.0,2021,233

Hip Hop integrated group work with adolescents has increased in the literature, with an emphasis on being more culturally responsive and engaging compared to traditional therapeutic approaches. Levy and Travis (J Spec Group Work 45:307–330, 2020) found in their research that while all Hip Hop integrated groups were effective, the semi-structured group had the most significant reduction in symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety, compared to the highly structured and minimally structured groups. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether a Hip Hop integrated intervention, that is multi-modal and interdisciplinary (i.e., blending two distinct models [HHE/CCMC] and facilitated by a social worker and school counselor). could effectively promote positive social and emotional development, across three leadership styles. Three groups of six high school students (total n = 18), identifying predominantly as Latinx and Black, were selected from a high school summer enrichment program. Results suggest social and emotional benefits for youth across all groups, regardless of facilitation style. Benefits included increased confidence, a strong sense of community, experiencing joy, and a willingness to step outside of their comfort zones to collaborate and create something personally meaningful.

It is aimed to demonstrate the effect of the pandemic on access to the healthcare setting in the parasitology direct diagnosis laboratory. METHODS Stool parasitological examination results were obtained retrospectively from the laboratory information system. Data belonging to the one-year of pandemic, lock-down and gradual normalization periods and their time equivalents were compared retrospectively. RESULTS During pandemic, parasites were detected in 529 of 2.233 samples. Parasites were detected in 58 of the 178 samples during the lock-down period and 471 of the 2.055 samples in the gradual normalization period. Incidence of Cryptosporidium spp. increased during the pandemic and lock-down periods. Incidence of Blastocystis spp. decreased during the pandemic and gradual normalization periods. Incidence of Giardia intestinalis decreased during the pandemic and gradual normalization periods. Incidence of Entamoeba histolytica/dispar increased during the pandemic and gradual normalization periods Incidence of Cyclospora spp. increased during the pandemic and gradual normalization periods. Incidence of Enterobius vermicularis decreased during the pandemic and gradual normalization periods and no case was seen during the lock-down period. CONCLUSION Although the incidence of parasites gives the impression that COVID-19 does not cause weakness in the fight against intestinal parasitic diseases, there may be parasitic infections with a similar frequency in the society that cannot access the laboratory. It is predicted that the effects of this vulnerability may lead to an increase in the incidence of parasites in postpandemic period.",2022-05-23,"Zorbozan, Orçun",Turkiye parazitolojii dergisi,,,https://doi.org/10.4274/tpd.galenos.2022.57338; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35604190/,248985585.0,2022,245

Phenotypic Differences Between Distinct Immune Biomarker Clusters During the ‘Hyperinflammatory’ Middle-Phase of COVID-19,10.1093/ofid/ofab466.637,PMC8644901,,cc-by,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections peak during an inflammatory ‘middle’ phase and lead to severe illness predominately among those with certain comorbid noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). We used network machine learning to identify inflammation biomarker patterns associated with COVID-19 among those with NCDs. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive subjects who had specimens available within 15-28 days post-symptom onset were selected from the DoD/USU EPICC COVID-19 cohort study. Plasma levels of 15 inflammation protein biomarkers were measured using a broad dynamic range immunoassay on samples collected from individuals with COVID-19 at 8 military hospitals across the United States. A network machine learning algorithm, topological data analysis (TDA), was performed using results from the ‘hyperinflammatory’ middle phase. Backward selection stepwise logistic regression was used to identify analytes associated with each cluster. NCDs with a significant association (0.05 significance level) across clusters using Fisher’s exact test were further evaluated comparing the NCD frequency in each cluster against all other clusters using a Kruskal-Wallis test. A sensitivity analysis excluding mild disease was also performed. RESULTS: The analysis population (n=129, 33.3% female, median 41.3 years of age) included 77 ambulatory, 31 inpatient, 16 ICU-level, and 5 fatal cases. TDA identified 5 unique clusters (Figure 1). Stepwise regression with a Bonferroni-corrected cutoff adjusted for severity identified representative analytes for each cluster (Table 1). The frequency of diabetes (p=0.01), obesity (p< 0.001), and chronic pulmonary disease (p< 0.001) differed among clusters. When restricting to hospitalized patients, obesity (8 of 11), chronic pulmonary disease (6 of 11), and diabetes (6 of 11) were more prevalent in cluster C than all other clusters.

The TEAMeD-5 programme recommends all patients with moderate-to-severe TED should have access to multidisciplinary clinics (MDT) with combined Ophthalmology and Endocrinology expertise. METHODS: The British Oculoplastic Surgery Society represents oculoplastic surgeons who usually lead TED care in the UK. A two-stage survey of the membership was conducted to ascertain current practice of existing resources. RESULTS: Seventy percent (45/65) of respondents in Survey 1 were aware of current RCP guidance, but only 49% (22/45) rated it as a good means of improving access to comprehensive TED service. Sixty percent (39/65) of respondents are working in a multidisciplinary TED clinic with co-location of ophthalmologists and endocrinologists. Care for TED appears not to be provided in a multidisciplinary context in up to 31% (20/65). Thirty five (54%) of the respondents rated their relationship with endocrinology colleagues as good. Best practice guidelines recommend routine quality of life assessments but only 6/28 (21%) of respondents use this modality in current practice. Six percent (4/65) of areas appear not to be using intravenous steroids. In many areas (25%, 16/65), second-line immunosuppression is provided in a different trust and in 8% (5/65), it appears not to be used at all.

Dans ce contexte, une plateforme nationale informatisée permettant l’auto-inscription de volontaires a été mise en place. Ce concept inédit en France permet de cibler les populations correspondant aux critères d’inclusion, d’assurer une répartition géographique et de garantir aux promoteurs, industriels ou académiques, le recrutement rapide dans les essais. L’objectif du travail présenté ici est de décrire les caractéristiques des volontaires inscrits. Matériels et méthodes Un appel à volontaires a été lancé le 01/10/2020 sous la forme d’une conférence de presse. Il a aussi été relayé par les médecins généralistes. Tout adulte pouvait s’inscrire sur une plateforme déclarée à la CNIL accessible à partir d’un site internet contenant des informations sur le développement des vaccins COVID-19. Le volontaire devait renseigner son identité et ses coordonnées, donner expressément son consentement puis des informations concernant : – son poids, sa taille et l’existence d’une ou plusieurs comorbidités (diabète, hypertension artérielle, maladie cardiaque et/ou respiratoire, insuffisance rénale, transplantation d’organe solide, maladie auto-immune et cancer) ; – la prise d’un traitement au long cours, notamment d’un immunosuppresseur ; – son exposition à la COVID-19 (professionnel de santé, métier au contact du public) ou un antécédent de COVID-19 ; – sa participation antérieure à un essai clinique. Les données des volontaires inscrits entre le 01/10/2020 et le 21/12/2020 ayant donné leur consentement et dont les données d’identité étaient complètes ont fait l’objet de cette analyse, effectuée avec le logiciel STATA®. Résultats Au total, 45503 inscriptions ont été enregistrées, dont 44611 (98%) analysées ici. Il s’agit d’hommes dans 63% des cas (n = 28049, sexratio : 1,7); l’âge médian est de 51 ans (IQR : 35-63 ans). Les personnes âgées de 65 ans et plus représentent 22% (n = 9551) des volontaires; 1,2% (n = 507) ont 80 ans et plus. Au moins une comorbidité est présente chez 14609 (39%) volontaires: 16% d’obésité (n = 6054), 16,5 % d’hypertension artérielle (n = 6243), 6% de diabète (n = 2251), 6,6% de maladie cardiaque (n = 2493), 9,9% de maladie respiratoire (n = 3747), 0,4 % d’insuffisance rénale (n = 160), 5,2 % de maladie auto-immune (n = 1976), 0,8% de cancer (n = 306) et 0,3% de transplantés (n = 117).

Disruptions in the drug market are expected and shortages might worsen. Community pharmacies can contribute to early identification and report of medicines’ supply and demand issues. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to characterize the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on outpatient medicines’ sales and shortages. METHODS: A retrospective, time-trend analysis of medicine sales, shortages and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases was performed from February 1st to April 30th, 2020, and its homologous period (regarding sales only). A detailed analysis of 6 pharmaceutical substances was performed. All data were subjected to rescaling using the min-max normalization method, in order to become comparable. Data analysis was performed using Microsoft® Excel. RESULTS: The pandemic resulted in an increase in medicines’ demand and reported shortages during the early stage of the outbreak. The maximum proportion of medicine sales was registered on March 13th, 2020, 4 days after the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. By the end of March, sales have already dropped to proportions similar to those of 2019. The maximum proportion of drug shortages was reached about one week after the sales peak and by the end of the study period were below those recorded in the pre-COVID-19 period. The analyzed drugs were paracetamol, ascorbic acid, dapagliflozin plus metformin, rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe, formoterol, and hydroxychloroquine, as these pharmaceutical substances registered the highest growth rate in sales and shortages when compared to the same period in the previous year. Hydroxychloroquine showed the most different pattern trends on sales and shortages of these medicines. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacies can provide timely and real-world data regarding sales and shortages.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has also triggered an unprecedented “infodemic”; the velocity and volume of data production have overwhelmed many key stakeholders such as clinicians and policy makers, as they have been unable to process structured and unstructured data for evidence-based decision making. Solutions that aim to alleviate this data synthesis–related challenge are unable to capture heterogeneous web data in real time for the production of concomitant answers and are not based on the high-quality information in responses to a free-text query. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this project is to build a generic, real-time, continuously updating curation platform that can support the data synthesis and analysis of a scientific literature framework. Our secondary objective is to validate this platform and the curation methodology for COVID-19–related medical literature by expanding the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset via the addition of new, unstructured data. METHODS: To create an infrastructure that addresses our objectives, the PanSurg Collaborative at Imperial College London has developed a unique data pipeline based on a web crawler extraction methodology. This data pipeline uses a novel curation methodology that adopts a human-in-the-loop approach for the characterization of quality, relevance, and key evidence across a range of scientific literature sources. RESULTS: REDASA (Realtime Data Synthesis and Analysis) is now one of the world’s largest and most up-to-date sources of COVID-19–related evidence; it consists of 104,000 documents. By capturing curators’ critical appraisal methodologies through the discrete labeling and rating of information, REDASA rapidly developed a foundational, pooled, data science data set of over 1400 articles in under 2 weeks. These articles provide COVID-19–related information and represent around 10% of all papers about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This data set can act as ground truth for the future implementation of a live, automated systematic review. The three benefits of REDASA’s design are as follows: (1) it adopts a user-friendly, human-in-the-loop methodology by embedding an efficient, user-friendly curation platform into a natural language processing search engine; (2) it provides a curated data set in the JavaScript Object Notation format for experienced academic reviewers’ critical appraisal choices and decision-making methodologies; and (3) due to the wide scope and depth of its web crawling method, REDASA has already captured one of the world’s largest COVID-19–related data corpora for searches and curation.",2021-05-06,"Vaghela, Uddhav; Rabinowicz, Simon; Bratsos, Paris; Martin, Guy; Fritzilas, Epameinondas; Markar, Sheraz; Purkayastha, Sanjay; Stringer, Karl; Singh, Harshdeep; Llewellyn, Charlie; Dutta, Debabrata; Clarke, Jonathan M; Howard, Matthew; Serban, Ovidiu; Kinross, James",J Med Internet Res,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33835932/; https://doi.org/10.2196/25714,233200537.0,2021,392

Until August 17, COVID 19 has hit more than 22 million individuals all over the globe. So, it is urged to get clear information about the prevalence of the virus. Therefore, one can manipulate easily a suitable mathematical model to fit these published data. METHODS: We propose a mathematical model that considers the total population, in 25 countries, either infected by COVID 19 or confined (safe) during the period from November 17, 2019, to August 17, 2020. The model considers the total population as a complex number; the imaginary part is the number of infected individuals and the real part is the number of confined individuals. This classification combined with mathematical treatments leads to a transmission dynamics of the virus to be as wave-like motion. The virus can hit any country either by one wave or by successive waves (up to 11 waves). FINDINGS: We find net discrimination between the 25 countries investigated in this report. The immediate response to the first attack is a substantial parameter to determine whether the epidemic attack will be in one wave or it can be in successive waves. For example, the best case was such as individuals in China hit by one wave while the individuals in the USA were attacked by nine waves; it is the worst case all over the globe. In addition, the model differentiates between the daily reproduction numbers (R(d0)) and the median reproduction number (R(0)). We have found that R(d0) decreases exponentially with time from high values down to zero at the wave maximum point; and R(0) varies from a country to another. For example, the virus hit individuals in Germany in R(0) = 1.39 (96% CI 1.01–3.87) and in the USA R(0) = 3.81 (91% CI 1.71–5.15). We have found that twice the virus has hit both the USA and Iran. The great protestation of black matter lives in the USA and the great assemblage of the new Iranian year, on March 21, 2020, have been the cause of the second epidemic attack in both countries. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that COVID 19 transmission depends on the prompt reaction against the first viral-wave. The reaction depends on both the social behaviour of individuals and on the swift system-decision by the governmental decision-maker(s). The Chinese strictly follow the decision-maker and therefore the virus hit by only one wave; while in the USA, the system-decision was different and the American-responses were different, therefore ten waves followed the first wave.

However, the current development in Swedish primary care is to blend digital solutions with traditional solutions. This paper addresses this development by examining the normalization of embedding and integrating a digital health care platform into everyday care routines in a primary care clinic. The digital health care platform enables both synchronous (video calls) and asynchronous (chat) communication, as well as self-registration of patient data using automated questions and forms requiring the patient’s input. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the work that health care professionals (HCPs) have to undertake to implement and sustain a digital health care platform as part of their everyday work practice. METHODS: HCPs were observed and interviewed to assess their individual and collective engagement and the mechanisms involved in the implementation of the digital platform and its effects on everyday work routines. The normalization process theory (NPT) was used to frame the data analysis. RESULTS: The analysis identified several themes related to the four NPT constructs: coherence, cognitive participation, collective action, and reflexive monitoring. The use of these constructs enabled the analysis to identify ways of supporting implementation. For example, it showed the benefits of having implementation champions and scheduling work hours for HCPs to use the platform. The analysis also revealed a theme of materiality that deviated from the NPT constructs, as NPT gives ontological priority to human actors and social structures. CONCLUSIONS: Digital health care platform implementation is a complex process. Our findings provide insights into how individual and collective actions can be supported to embed and integrate a digital platform into everyday care routines. Primary health care organizations need to involve HCPs throughout the implementation process by reorganizing work and providing frequent feedback loops. HCPs are more likely to engage with and commit to changing practices if they perceive the digital platform to be beneficial compared with the current practice. However, they also need resources (eg, time, training, and continuous support) to put the platform into practice. Patient engagement and appraisal are important elements in implementation. Unless patients are willing to use the platform, there is no motivation for HCPs to embed the digital platform into everyday care practice.",2022-02-22,"Frennert, Susanne; Erlingsdóttir, Gudbjörg; Muhic, Mirella; Rydenfält, Christofer; Milos Nymberg, Veronica; Ekman, Björn",JMIR Form Res,,document_parses/pdf_json/769856a55e8ff438bb3c653031df5fc3b2341a97.json,https://doi.org/10.2196/30527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35191845/,247025100.0,2022,370

The aim of this study was to investigate whether hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) blocks autophagy and promotes apoptosis of the prostate after castration. METHODS Thirty-six male SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups (n = 12): control group (sham operation), castration group, and HCQ group (castrated and treated with HCQ). On day 7, all mice were executed and prostates were isolated. The morphological changes of prostates were observed by light microscope, and the ultrastructure changes were observed under scanning electron microscope (SEM). The protein expression of Beclin-l, P62, caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax was assessed by immunohistochemical analyses. The mRNA expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5) was detected by RT-PCR. RESULTS Prostates of castration group shrank remarkably and prostates of HCQ group shrank more remarkably than castration group. Cytolysosomes were visible in the prostates of the castration group under SEM. Immunohistochemistry showed that the protein of Beclin-1 increased in the castration group compared to the control group, while decreased in the HCQ group compared to the castration group. While P62 protein moderately dyed in the control group and weakly dyed in the castration group, it strongly dyed in the HCQ group. Caspase-3 and Bax protein were weakly dyed in the control group but moderately dyed in the castration group and strongly dyed in the HCQ group. The expressions of apoptosis suppressor Bcl-2 were reduced in the castration group and further reduced in the HCQ group compared to the castration group. RT-PCR revealed that the mRNA of LC3 and Atg5 in the castration group increased compared to the control group, while decreased after treated with HCQ.

Recent efforts are being made to evaluate different viral concentration methodologies to overcome supplier shortages during lockdowns. A set of 22-wastewater samples seeded with murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, and the bacteriophage MS2, were used to characterize and compare two ultrafiltration-based methods: a centrifugal ultrafiltration device (Centricon® Plus-70) and the automated concentrating pipette CP-Select™. Based on the recovery efficiencies, significant differences were observed for MHV, with Centricon® Plus-70 (24%) being the most efficient method. Nevertheless, concentrations of naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2, Human adenoviruses and JC polyomaviruses in these samples did not result in significant differences between methods suggesting that testing naturally occurring viruses may complement the evaluation of viral concentration methodologies.

This is only attainable if countries with substantial wind energy potential use it in significant proportion to satisfy their energy needs. One promising sector where wind energy can be employed to actualize this potential is the electricity sector. However, the current reality is that fossil fuels still dominate the energy profiles of most economies of the world, including the advanced economies, with wind renewable energy source accounting for a very small proportion of the energy mix. Germany is one of the few countries that offers promising opportunities in deploying wind energy to its full potentials. This study therefore explores the feasibility of substituting wind energy for nuclear energy and other fossil fuels using Germany as a country of focus. We use the ridge regression procedure to analyse yearly time series data for the German power sector that spans the period 1986 to 2018. With respect to output elasticities of the energy inputs, the results reveal that wind and natural gas have positive output elasticity estimates while the estimates for nuclear and coal are negative. We also found that all the inputs pairs have positive substitution elasticity estimates between them. With respect to wind energy, the highest substitutability estimate occurred with nuclear power which is followed by natural gas and then coal. The study recommended that policies such as granting of tax credit for wind energy technology, reduction in property taxes for wind power facilities, and allocation of fund for research and development (R&D) in wind energy technology are recommended to promote the use of wind energy in the economy.",2021-09-15,"Solarin, Sakiru Adebola; Bello, Mufutau Opeyemi",Environ Dev Sustain,,document_parses/pdf_json/042eccacef2ce5a64de0ebdf27f2775d8716ac39.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01818-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34539230/,237509660.0,2021,282

Each task replicates activities of daily living performed in a familiar environment. The main goal of the present study was to ascertain whether Smart Aging could differentiate between different types and levels of cognitive impairment in patients with neurodegenerative disease. Methods: Ninety-one subjects (mean age = 70.29 ± 7.70 years)—healthy older adults (HCs, n = 23), patients with single-domain amnesic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, n = 23), patients with single-domain executive Parkinson's disease MCI (PD-MCI, n = 20), and patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (mild AD, n = 25)—were enrolled in the study. All participants underwent cognitive evaluations performed using both traditional neuropsychological assessment tools, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Overall Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and the Smart Aging platform. We analyzed global scores on Smart Aging indices (i.e., accuracy, time, distance) as well as the Smart Aging total score, looking for differences between the four groups. Results: The findings revealed significant between-group differences in all the Smart Aging indices: accuracy (p < 0.001), time (p < 0.001), distance (p < 0.001), and total Smart Aging score (p < 0.001). The HCs outperformed the mild AD, aMCI, and PD-MCI patients in terms of accuracy, time, distance, and Smart Aging total score. In addition, the mild AD group was outperformed both by the HCs and by the aMCI and PD-MCI patients on accuracy and distance. No significant differences were found between aMCI and PD-MCI patients. Finally, the Smart Aging scores significantly correlated with the results of the neuropsychological assessments used.

It is one of the few countries with a strategic plan for health promotion implementation. Given the paucity of understanding in relation to the concept of a health promoting prison, this study assessed routinely collected prison inspection data to understand and distil learning in regard the practical implementation of health-promoting prisons. METHODS: Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland (HMIPS) oversees the independent inspection of all prisons. This desk-based study analysed openly accessible inspection reports from a public repository. The sample was limited to inspection reports using the 2018 revised Standards to ensure comparability between reports. Eight unique inspection reports meeting this criterion were downloaded between January and October 2020. The prisons had their inspections undertaken between May 2018 and January 2020. Data from the reports which focused on ‘health and wellbeing’ were inductively coded using NVivo 12 to support thematic analysis. RESULTS: Results are presented against the values and principles outlined in the SPS’ own framework for promoting health in prison. All of the institution reports contained evidence of fairness and justice in their prison and understandings of health inequalities were recognised by staff. There were also examples of mutual (peer) support between people in prison; good relationships between staff and prisoners; and strong health promotion leadership. Conversely, some environmental conditions hindered the development of health promotion – this included staffing shortages and some practices fostering health inequity. Even where a prison was reported as having health promotion activities in place these were focused on a narrow range of individual risk factors such as smoking cessation or substance misuse. Far less attention was paid to wider health determinants. CONCLUSIONS: Scotland has been at the forefront of attempts to embed a health promoting prison philosophy in their justice system. Inspection data focusing on ‘health and wellbeing’ were analysed, but the analysis suggests that more could be done to ensure a health promoting setting. The way prisons inspectors are assessing health and wellbeing in particular areas is very narrow, with the focus exclusively on healthcare without a wider appreciation of how other areas of prison life can impact.",2021-04-07,"Woodall, James; Freeman, Charlotte",BMC Health Serv Res,,document_parses/pdf_json/5089feb05514d86c500e788fe8b4d985d46131c1.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06337-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827565/,233177067.0,2021,368

We report a case series of 12 patients who received long venovenous ECMO (VV ECMO) runs for refractory hypoxia (median PF ratio of 71.8, interquartile range (IQR) 53.5–78.5) from COVID-19-related ARDS. A majority (75%) of the patients were males with a median age of 44 (IQR 37–53.5). Overall, six (50%) patients survived to hospital discharge with five of them (83.3%) noted to be cerebral performance category 1 or 2 at the time of discharge. Survivors consistently showed an improvement in sequential organ failure assessment scores within 72 hours of ECMO initiation. The median ECMO duration was 28 days (IQR 13.5–50). Despite using standard anticoagulation strategy, six (50%) of our patients had one or more major bleeding episodes, which proved to be directly fatal in four (25%) patients.

In light of the International Health Regulations (IHR)(2005), this study compares the organisation of RAEW in China and the Netherlands. The respective approaches towards surveillance of arboviral disease and unexplained pneumonia were analysed to gain a better understanding of the RAEW mode of operation. This study may be used to explore options for further strengthening of global collaboration and timely detection and surveillance of infectious disease outbreaks. METHODS: A qualitative study design was used, combining data retrieved from the literature and from semi-structured interviews with Chinese (5 national-level and 6 provincial-level) and Dutch (5 national-level) experts. RESULTS: The results show that some differences exist such as in the use of automated electronic components of the early warning system in China (‘CIDARS’), compared to a more limited automated component in the Netherlands (‘barometer’). Moreover, RAEW units in the Netherlands focus exclusively on infectious diseases, while China has a broader ‘all hazard’ approach (including for example chemical incidents). In the Netherlands, veterinary specialists take part at the RAEW meetings, to enable a structured exchange/assessment of zoonotic signals. CONCLUSION: Despite these differences, the main conclusion is that for the two infections studied, the early warning system in China and the Netherlands are remarkably similar considering their large differences in infectious disease history, population size and geographical setting.

For technical reasons, it has previously been difficult to determine their precise distribution on different cell types. Using a recombinant soluble form of the Influenza C virus hemagglutinin-esterase as a probe for 9-O-acetylated sialic acids, we demonstrate here their preferential expression on the CD4 T cell lineage in normal B10.A mouse lymphoid organs. Of total thymocytes, 8–10% carry 9-O-acetylation; the great majority of these are the more mature PNA(−), HSA(−), and TCR(hi) medullary cells. While low levels of 9-O-acetylation are seen on some CD4/CD8 double positive (DP) and CD8 single positive (SP) cells, high levels are present primarily on 80– 85% of CD4 SP cells. Correlation with CD4 and CD8 levels suggests that 9-O-acetylation appears as an early differentiation marker as cells mature from the DP to the CD4 SP phenotype. This high degree of 9-O-acetylation is also present on 90–95% of peripheral spleen and lymph node CD4 T cells. In contrast, only a small minority of CD8 T cells and B cells show such levels of 9-O-acetylation. Among mature peripheral CD4 T lymphocytes, the highly O-acetylated cells are Mel 14(hi), CD44(lo), and CD45R(exon B)(hi), features typical of naive cells. Digestions with trypsin and O-sialoglycoprotease (OSGPase) and ELISA studies of lipid extracts indicate that the 9-O-acetylated sialic acids on peripheral CD4 T cells are predominantly on O-linked mucintype glycoproteins and to a lesser degree, on sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides). In contrast, sialic acids on mucin type molecules of CD8 T cells are not O-acetylated; instead these molecules mask the recognition of O-acetylated gangliosides that seem to be present at similar levels as on CD4 cells. The 9-O-acetylated gangliosides on mouse T cells are not bound by CD60 antibodies, which recognize O-acetylated gangliosides in human T cells. Tethering 9-O-acetylated mucins with the Influenza C probe with or without secondary cross-linking did not cause activation of CD4 T cells. However, activation by other stimuli including TCR ligation is associated with a substantial decrease in surface 9-O-acetylation, primarily in the mucin glycoprotein component. Thus, 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on cell surface mucins is a novel marker on CD4 T cells that appears on maturation and is modulated downwards upon activation.",1997-06-02,"Krishna, Murli; Varki, Ajit",J Exp Med,,document_parses/pdf_json/ba4c40b65eb342713e70c96a8d6336b22cca54fc.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9166429/,1063942.0,1997,367

These measures have had severe impact on the economy and peoples' daily lives. An alternative to widespread lockdowns is effective contact tracing during an outbreak's early stage. However, mathematical models suggest that epidemic control for SARS-CoV-2 transmission with manual contact tracing is implausible. To reduce the effort of contact tracing, many digital contact tracing projects (e.g., PEPP-PT, DP-3T, TCN, BlueTrace, Google/Apple Exposure Notification, and East/West Coast PACT) are being developed to supplement manual contact tracing. However, digital contact tracing has drawn scrutiny from privacy advocates, since governments or other parties may attempt to use contact tracing protocols for mass surveillance. As a result, many digital contact tracing projects build privacy-preserving mechanisms to limit the amount of privacy-sensitive information leaked by the protocol. In this paper, we examine how these architectures resist certain classes of attacks, specifically DoS attacks, and present BlindSignedIDs, a privacy-preserving digital contact tracing mechanism, which are verifiable ephemeral identifiers to limit the effectiveness of MAC-compliant DoS attacks. In our evaluations, we showed BlindSignedID can effectively deny bogus EphIDs, mitigating DoS attacks on the local storage beyond 90% of stored EphIDs. Our example DoS attacks showed that using 4 attackers can cause the gigabyte level DoS attacks within normal working hours and days.",2020-08-21,"Chen, Bo-Rong; Hu, Yih-Chun",,,document_parses/pdf_json/4e84f6a67b0cb8087b5948f5b161bdd66d565c48.json,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.09351v2.pdf,221246353.0,2020,228

In this study, we wanted to assess the neutralizing capacity of antibodies to prevent cell infection, using a live virus neutralisation test. Methods: Sera samples were collected from different populations: two-dose vaccinated COVID-19-naive healthcare workers (HCWs; Pfizer-BioNTech BNT161b2), 6-months post mild COVID-19 HCWs, and critical COVID-19 patients. We tested various clades such as 19A (initial one), 20B (B.1.1.241 lineage), 20I/501Y.V1 (B.1.1.7 lineage), and 20H/501Y.V2 (B.1.351 lineage). Results: No significant difference was observed between the 20B and 19A isolates for HCWs with mild COVID-19 and critical patients. However, a significant decrease in neutralisation ability was found for 20I/501Y.V1 in comparison with 19A isolate for critical patients and HCWs 6-months post infection. Concerning 20H/501Y.V2, all populations had a significant reduction in neutralising antibody titres in comparison with the 19A isolate. Interestingly, a significant difference in neutralisation capacity was observed for vaccinated HCWs between the two variants whereas it was not significant for the convalescent groups. Conclusion: Neutralisation capacity was slightly reduced for critical patients and HCWs 6-months post infection. No neutralisation escape could be feared concerning the two variants of concern in both populations. The reduced neutralising response observed towards the 20H/501Y.V2 in comparison with the 19A and 20I/501Y.V1 isolates in fully immunized subjects with the BNT162b2 vaccine is a striking finding of the study.",2021-05-11,"Gonzalez, C.; Saade, C.; Bal, A.; Valette, M.; Saker, K.; Lina, B.; Josset, L.; Trabaud, M.-A.; Thiery, G.; Botelho-Nevers, E.; Paul, S.; Verhoeven, P.; Bourlet, T.; Pillet, S.; Morfin, F.; Trouillet-Assant, S.; Pozzetto, B.",,,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.21256578; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.11.21256578v1?rss=1,234359754.0,2021,234

Four hours after injection with LPS or saline, blood, spleen, and liver samples were collected and subjected to transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), metabolomics, and specific reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Differential expression analysis was at the gene, pathway, and network levels. LPS-treated deermice showed signs of sickness similar to those of exposed mice and had similar increases in corticosterone levels and expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor, IL-1β, and C-reactive protein. By network analysis, the M. musculus response to LPS was characterized as cytokine associated, while the P. leucopus response was dominated by neutrophil activity terms. In addition, dichotomies in the expression levels of arginase 1 and nitric oxide synthase 2 and of IL-10 and IL-12 were consistent with type M1 macrophage responses in mice and type M2 responses in deermice. Analysis of metabolites in plasma and RNA in organs revealed species differences in tryptophan metabolism. Two genes in particular signified the different phenotypes of deermice and mice: the Slpi and Ibsp genes.

Human disease models have proven valuable for their ability to closely mimic disease patterns in vitro, permitting the study of pathophysiological features and new treatment options. Although animal studies remain the gold standard for preclinical testing, they have major drawbacks such as high cost and ongoing controversy over their predictive value for several human conditions.

As such, miRNAs are indirectly involved in most cellular mechanisms, including cell differentiation, proliferation, survival, and homeostasis. Several different mechanisms finely regulate miRNA expression levels and functions. Among these, miRNA editing is a type of epitranscriptomic modification that alters the original nucleotide sequence of selected miRNAs, possibly influencing their conformational state and target-binding ability. To date, adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) and cytosine-to-uracil (C-to-U) RNA editing are recognized as the “canonical” editing types, with the A-to-I type being the predominant one. A comprehensive resource explicitly dedicated to miRNA editing data collection is still missing. Here we present MiREDiBase, a manually curated catalog of editing events in miRNAs. Overall, the current version includes 3059 unique A-to-I and C-to-U editing sites occurring in 626 human miRNA transcripts and three different species of non-human primates. Each editing event is provided with essential information and key relevant details, including biological sample, detection method, enzyme-dependent affinity, editing level, and biological function. Editing events in human mature miRNAs were provided with miRNA-target predictions and enrichment analysis. Minimum free energy structures were inferred for editing events falling into pre-miRNA regions, aiming to help users to interpret the biological information.

METHODS: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial in 36 centers in the U.S. between August 2020 and February 2021 investigated the safety and effectiveness of oral nitazoxanide 600 mg twice daily for five days in outpatients with symptoms of mild or moderate COVID-19 enrolled within 72 h of symptom onset (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04486313). Efficacy endpoints were time to sustained clinical recovery (TSR, a novel primary endpoint) and proportion of participants progressing to severe illness within 28 days (key secondary). FINDINGS: 1092 participants were enrolled. 379 with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were analyzed. In the primary analysis, median (IQR) TSR were 13·3 (6·3, >21) and 12·4 (7·2, >21) days for the nitazoxanide and placebo groups, respectively (p = 0·88). 1 of 184 (0·5%) treated with nitazoxanide progressed to severe illness compared to 7 of 195 (3·6%) treated with placebo (key secondary analysis, odds ratio 5·6 [95% CI 0·7 - 46·1], relative risk reduction 85%, p = 0·07). In the pre-defined stratum with mild illness at baseline, nitazoxanide-treated participants experienced reductions in median TSR (3·1 days, p = 0·09) and usual health (5·2 days, p < 0·01) compared to placebo. Nitazoxanide was safe and well tolerated.

We present feasibility and efficacy of DTG/3TC in newly diagnosed individuals in a test-and-treat setting. DESIGN: The single-arm STAT study evaluated DTG/3TC in a US test-and-treat setting. METHODS: Eligible adults initiated DTG/3TC 14 days or less after HIV-1 diagnosis without availability of baseline laboratory results. If baseline testing indicated DTG or 3TC resistance, HBV co-infection, or creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2), participants remained on study with treatment modification. Efficacy endpoints included proportions of participants with HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml at Week 24, regardless of antiretroviral regimen, among all participants (intention-to-treat exposed) and those with available HIV-1 RNA data (observed). RESULTS: Of 131 participants enrolled, 8% were female and 50% were non-white. Through Week 24, treatment was modified in eight participants [five with HBV co-infection, one with baseline M184V, one for adverse event (rash), one participant decision]. At Week 24, 78% (102/131) of all participants and 92% (102/111) of those with available data achieved HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies/ml. Incidence of drug-related adverse events was low (7%); no drug-related serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of using DTG/3TC as a first-line regimen in a test-and-treat setting, with therapy adjustments for baseline resistance or HBV co-infection occurring safely via routine clinical care as needed [ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03945981; see Supplemental Digital Content 1, video abstract (Video abstract summarizing the STAT study design and results)].",2021-10-01,"Rolle, Charlotte-Paige; Berhe, Mezgebe; Singh, Tulika; Ortiz, Roberto; Wurapa, Anson; Ramgopal, Moti; Leone, Peter A.; Matthews, Jessica E.; Dalessandro, Marybeth; Underwood, Mark R.; Angelis, Konstantinos; Wynne, Brian R.; Merrill, Deanna; Nguyen, Christopher; van Wyk, Jean; Zolopa, Andrew R.",AIDS,,document_parses/pdf_json/2970eb6262dddf011a7d3fc813d94cc79eb7bd91.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34115650/; https://doi.org/10.1097/qad.0000000000002979,235413314.0,2021,268

Even though respiratory failure is the cardinal form of severe COVID-19, concomitant cardiac involvement is common. Myocarditis is a challenging diagnosis due to heterogeneity of clinical presentation, ranging from mild symptoms to fatal arrhythmia and cardiogenic shock (CS). The aetiology is often viral and endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is the gold standard for definite myocarditis. However, the diagnosis is often made on medical history, clinical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging, and blood tests. CASE SUMMARY: We present a 43-year-old man with mixed connective tissue disease treated with hydroxychloroquine who rapidly developed CS 4 days from symptom onset with fever and cough, showing positive polymerase chain reaction nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. While computed tomography of the thorax was normal, high-sensitivity troponin T was elevated and electrocardiogram showed diffuse ST elevation and low voltage as signs of myocardial oedema. Echocardiography showed severe depression of left ventricular function. The myocardium recovered completely after a week with mechanical circulatory support (MCS). EMB was performed but could neither identify the virus in the cardiomyocytes, nor signs of inflammation. Still the most probable aetiology of CS in this case is myocarditis as a sole symptom of COVID-19. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 patients in need of hospitalization present commonly with respiratory manifestations. We present the first case of fulminant myocarditis rapidly progressing to CS in a COVID-19 patient without respiratory failure, successfully treated with inotropes and MCS.",2020-12-30,"Papageorgiou, Joanna-Maria; Almroth, Henrik; Törnudd, Mattias; van der Wal, Henriëtte; Varelogianni, Georgia; Lawesson, Sofia Sederholm",Eur Heart J Case Rep,,document_parses/pdf_json/52781f71d013a596fc200744a9878dddd12459c7.json,https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594347/,231699765.0,2020,255

Respiratory viruses (RVs) are detected by multiplex reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (mRT‐PCR) in up to 70% of infants tested in this population. Aminotransferase elevation is not uncommon in RV infections, and repeat laboratory investigations are frequent due to concerns regarding the occurrence of hepatic disease. METHODS: This retrospective observational cohort study included 271 infants aged 8‐90 days, with positive RV mRT‐PCR results. Data were obtained on demographics, laboratory results and final diagnoses of hepatobiliary disease. RESULTS: Fever (73.1%) and/or respiratory symptoms (75.6%) were the major presentations among the hospitalised infants. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were elevated in 62 (22.9%) of the 271 infants. Twenty‐four of these 62 infants had their first follow‐up, and 19 (79.2%) showed persistent elevation. All 10 (100%) infants who had their second follow‐up showed persistently elevated aminotransferase levels. Eventually, none of the 10 infants were diagnosed with hepatic disease during the median follow‐up of 10 days (range 3‐232 days). Among the RVs of interest, parainfluenza virus type 1 was significantly associated with aminotransferase elevation (odds ratio: 2.95; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11‐7.83). CONCLUSIONS: RV‐related non‐specific hepatitis is occasionally observed in infants aged 8‐90 days, and ALT elevation is the most common abnormality. However, a final diagnosis of primary hepatobiliary disease appears to be rare.

Co-infections lead to the exacerbation of clinical symptoms and lesions. Mycoplasma gallisepticum (M. gallispeticum) and Avian Metapneumovirus (AMPV) are two avian respiratory pathogens that co-circulate worldwide. The knowledge about the host–pathogen interaction of M. gallispeticum and AMPV in the chicken respiratory tract is limited. We aimed to investigate how co-infections affect the pathogenesis of the respiratory disease and whether the order of invading pathogens leads to changes in host–pathogen interaction. We used chicken tracheal organ cultures (TOC) to investigate pathogen invasion and replication, lesion development, and selected innate immune responses, such as interferon (IFN) α, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and IFNλ mRNA expression levels. We performed mono-inoculations (AMPV or M. gallispeticum) or dual-inoculations in two orders with a 24-h interval between the first and second pathogen. Dual-inoculations compared to mono-inoculations resulted in more severe host reactions. Pre-infection with AMPV followed by M. gallispeticum resulted in prolonged viral replication, more significant innate immune responses, and lesions (p < 0.05). AMPV as the secondary pathogen impaired the bacterial attachment process. Consequently, the M. gallispeticum replication was delayed, the innate immune response was less pronounced, and lesions appeared later. Our results suggest a competing process in co-infections and offer new insights in disease processes.",2021-11-22,"Rüger, Nancy; Sid, Hicham; Meens, Jochen; Szostak, Michael P.; Baumgärtner, Wolfgang; Bexter, Frederik; Rautenschlein, Silke",Microorganisms,,document_parses/pdf_json/0d7c46c9bfa6ecf540a068db30061bc88864f9b3.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8618481/,,2021,210

Healthcare facilities had to set up logistics to avoid being drained while facing a catastrophic health problem. There are currently no available vaccines or perfect therapies and also no certified immunity against that disease. Therefore, it is probable that healthcare systems will face it for an exceptionally long period. That will have a grave effect on the strategy of daily practice of different specialties' services at healthcare centers. Impossible decisions in usual workdays are now forcibly adopted for the sake of patients, care providers, and health resources. METHODS: We try in a simple way to share tertiary center expertise in managing neurosurgical cases amid a dreadful healthcare crisis. Healthcare workers' safety and patient safety were typical priorities for neurosurgical service at King Abdullah Medical City. We expose the lines of management, triaging cases, the methods of handling confirmed and suspected neurosurgical patients, and strategies for discharging and following up patients. We identified hospital admission and discharge records starting from March 2020 till July to track the neurosurgical case burden and the state of service offered and the rate of infection among healthcare workers who participated in surgeries. RESULTS: At the peak time of the COVID-19 pandemic in Makka starting from March till July, we have admitted 250 neurosurgical patients. About 210 (84%) of them did surgeries according to the triaging protocol described in the article. About 155 (62%) of those who did surgeries were urgent and the rest were borderline or semi-urgent. About 10 (4%) were severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive and three of them died due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Only two mortality cases were reported due to a neurological complication and not related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rest of the cases (98%) were discharged for follow-up without grave complications after they were offered the service. No neurosurgeons or anesthesia staff involved in offering the service were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Successful uninterrupted neurosurgical care was available for patients during that health crisis without any healthcare worker being infected.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Eight hospitals in Southeast Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: 3219 hospitalised patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal PCR test from 13 March 2020 until 29 April 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Outcomes were discharge from the hospital or in-hospital death. Examined predictors included patient demographics, chronic diseases, home medications, mechanical ventilation, in-hospital medications and timeframe of hospital admission. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 3219 (90.4%) patients were discharged or died in the hospital. The median age was 65.2 (IQR 52.6–77.2) years, the median length of stay in the hospital was 6.0 (IQR 3.2–10.1) days, and 51% were female. Hypertension was the most common chronic disease, occurring in 2386 (74.1%) patients. Overall mortality rate was 16.0%. Blacks represented 52.3% of patients and had a mortality rate of 13.5%. Mortality was highest at 18.5% in the prepeak hospital COVID-19 volume, decreasing to 15.3% during the peak period and to 10.8% in the postpeak period. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.05, p<0.001) for every increase in 1 year of age and being male (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.81, p<0.001). Certain chronic diseases increased the odds of in-hospital mortality, especially chronic kidney disease.

Alcohol and opioid use disorders (AUD/OUD) significantly increase risk for suicidal ideation, attempts, and death, and are the two most frequently implicated substances in suicide risk. We provide a brief overview of shared risk factors and pathways in the pathogenesis of AUD/OUD and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. We also review clinical recommendations on inpatient care, pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapeutic interventions for people with AUD/OUD and co-occurring suicidal ideation and behavior. RECENT FINDINGS: Among people with an underlying vulnerability to risk-taking and impulsive behaviors, chronic alcohol intoxication can increase maladaptive coping behaviors and hinder self-regulation, thereby increasing the risk of suicide. Additionally, chronic opioid use can result in neurobiological changes that lead to increases in negative affective states, jointly contributing to suicide risk and continued opioid use. Despite significantly elevated suicide risk in individuals with AUD/OUD, there is a dearth of research on pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for co-occurring AUD/OUD and suicidal ideation and behavior. SUMMARY: Further research is needed to understand the effects of alcohol and opioid use on suicide risk, as well as address notable gaps in the literature on psychosocial and pharmacological interventions to lower risk for suicide among individuals with AUD/OUD.",2021-03-14,"Rizk, Mina M.; Herzog, Sarah; Dugad, Sanjana; Stanley, Barbara",Curr Addict Rep,,document_parses/pdf_json/160ee44a7c67050341ef8879033c1e4bc0ea13b3.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7955902/,,2021,212

In this study, we find that dual-specificity phosphatase 16 (DUSP16) regulates resistance to chemotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, colorectal cancer, gastric and breast cancer. Cancer cells expressing higher DUSP16 are intrinsically more resistant to chemotherapy-induced cell death than cells with lower DUSP16 expression. Overexpression of DUSP16 in cancer cells leads to increased resistance to cell death upon chemotherapy treatment. In contrast, knockdown of DUSP16 in cancer cells increases their sensitivity to treatment. Mechanistically, DUSP16 inhibits JNK and p38 activation, thereby reducing BAX accumulation in mitochondria to reduce apoptosis. Analysis of patient survival in head & neck cancer and breast cancer patient cohorts supports DUSP16 as a marker for sensitivity to chemotherapy and therapeutic outcome. This study therefore identifies DUSP16 as a prognostic marker for the efficacy of chemotherapy, and as a therapeutic target for overcoming chemoresistance in cancer.",2021-04-16,"Low, Heng Boon; Wong, Zhen Lim; Wu, Bangyuan; Kong, Li Ren; Png, Chin Wen; Cho, Yik-Lam; Li, Chun-Wei; Xiao, Fengchun; Xin, Xuan; Yang, Henry; Loo, Jia Min; Lee, Fiona Yi Xin; Tan, Iain Bee Huat; DasGupta, Ramanuj; Shen, Han-Ming; Schwarz, Herbert; Gascoigne, Nicholas R J; Goh, Boon Cher; Xu, Xiaohong; Zhang, Yongliang",Nature communications,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-22638-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33863904/,233278667.0,2021,150

Yet, a formal analysis of how the medical literature has changed during the pandemic is lacking. In this analysis, we aimed to quantify how scientific publications changed at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional bibliometric study of published studies in four high-impact medical journals to identify differences in the characteristics of COVID-19 related publications compared to non-pandemic studies. Original investigations related to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 published in March and April 2020 were identified and compared to non-COVID-19 research publications over the same two-month period in 2019 and 2020. Extracted data included publication characteristics, study characteristics, author characteristics, and impact metrics. Our primary measure was principal component analysis (PCA) of publication characteristics and impact metrics across groups. RESULTS: We identified 402 publications that met inclusion criteria: 76 were related to COVID-19; 154 and 172 were non-COVID publications over the same period in 2020 and 2019, respectively. PCA utilizing the collected bibliometric data revealed segregation of the COVID-19 literature subset from both groups of non-COVID literature (2019 and 2020). COVID-19 publications were more likely to describe prospective observational (31.6%) or case series (41.8%) studies without industry funding as compared with non-COVID articles, which were represented primarily by randomized controlled trials (32.5% and 36.6% in the non-COVID literature from 2020 and 2019, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In this cross-sectional study of publications in four general medical journals, COVID-related articles were significantly different from non-COVID articles based on article characteristics and impact metrics. COVID-related studies were generally shorter articles reporting observational studies with less literature cited and fewer study sites, suggestive of more limited scientific support.

In an effort to augment the capabilities of existing diagnostic methodologies, the use of virus-specific DNA microarray technology has been recently applied in both research and clinical settings with favorable results. The primary advantage of this approach is that DNA microarrays containing literally thousands of virus-specific sequences allow simultaneous testing for essentially all known viral species. While previous methods have been limited to testing for a single pathogen, or small numbers of specific pathogens, a panviral assay is less biased and can be designed to detect variant or even novel members of existing viral families. The use of DNA microarrays in both research and clinical settings has the potential to substantially increase the number of instances in which a virus may be identified in biological samples. With the proper bioinformatics methodologies, this technology will also maximize the probability that previously uncharacterized pathogens are detected potentially leading to an improved understanding of the etiology for many chronic human diseases.

These antibodies may serve as protection against COVID-19 in infants. However, the evolution of these human milk antibodies over time is unclear. RESEARCH AIM To elucidate the evolution of immunoglobulin A (IgA) against SARS-CoV-2 in human milk after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS This longitudinal follow-up study included lactating mothers (N = 24) who had participated in the COVID MILK study. To assess the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, serum and human milk samples were collected 14-143 days after the onset of clinical symptoms related to COVID-19. Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay was used to detect antibodies against the ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. RESULTS SARS-CoV-2 antibodies remain present up to 5 months (143 days) in human milk after onset of COVID-19 symptoms. Overall, SARS-CoV-2 IgA in human milk seems to gradually decrease over time. CONCLUSION Human milk from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent lactating mothers contains specific IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein up to at least 5 months post-infection. Passive viral immunity can be transferred via human milk and may serve as protection for infants against COVID-19.

Most physicians prefer anticoagulants over antiplatelet agents for stroke prevention. However, this approach is not evidence-based and antiplatelets might be as safe and as effective. The 'Biomarkers and Antithrombotic Treatment in Cervical Artery Dissection' ('TREAT-CAD') trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02046460) compares Aspirin to oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists) with regard to efficacy and safety by using both clinical and imaging surrogate outcome measures. TREAT-CAD tests the hypothesis, that aspirin is as safe and effective as vitamin K antagonists. Patients and methods TREAD-CAD is a Prospective, Randomised controlled, Open-labelled, multicentre, non-inferiority trial with Blinded assessment of outcome Events (PROBE-design). Key eligibility criteria are (i) clinical symptoms attributable to cervical artery dissection and (ii) verification of the cervical artery dissection diagnosis by established magnetic resonance imaging criteria. Patients are randomised to receive either Aspirin 300 mg daily or vitamin K antagonists for 90 days. Results Primary outcomes are assessed at 14 ± 10 days (magnetic resonance imaging and clinical examination) and at 90 ± 30 days (clinical examinations). The primary endpoint is a composite outcome measure - labelled Cerebrovascular Ischemia, major Hemorrhagic events or Death (CIHD) - and includes (i) occurrence of any stroke (including retinal infarction), (ii) new ischaemic lesions on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, (iii) any major extracranial haemorrhage, (iv) any symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage, (v) any new haemorrhagic lesion visible on paramagnetic-susceptible sequences and (vi) death. Discussion After database closure, (i) central verification of cervical artery dissection diagnosis will be done by two experienced raters, (ii) adjudication of outcome events will be performed by independent adjudication committees, separately for clinical and imaging outcomes. The primary analysis will be done on the per protocol data set. The targeted sample size consists of 169 evaluable patients in the per protocol data set. Conclusion TREAT-CAD is testing the non-inferiority of Aspirin versus vitamin K antagonists treatment in patients with symptomatic cervical artery dissection by combined clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcomes.",2020-09-01,"Traenka, Christopher; Gensicke, Henrik; Schaedelin, Sabine; Luft, Andreas; Arnold, Marcel; Michel, Patrik; Kägi, Georg; Kahles, Timo; Nolte, Christian H; Kellert, Lars; Rosenbaum, Sverre; Sztaizel, Roman; Brehm, Alex; Stippich, Christoph; Psychogios, Marios; Lyrer, Philippe; Engelter, Stefan T",European stroke journal,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/2396987320921151; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33072885/,222111248.0,2020,333

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many companies have instituted work from home (WFH) policies in accordance with public health guidelines in order to increase social distancing and decrease the spread of COVID-19. As the pandemic and WFH-related policies have continued for more than a year, there has been a rise in people becoming accustomed to the remote environments; however, others are more enthusiastic about returning to in-person work environments, reflecting the desire to restore pre-pandemic environments. As working from home is related to transportation issues such as changing commuting patterns and decreased congestion, motorized trips, and emission, there is a need to explore the extent of public attitudes on this important issue. This study used unique open-source survey data that provides substantial information on this topic. Using an advanced categorical data analysis method known as cluster correspondence analysis, this study identified several key findings. Not having prior WFH experiences, being eager to interact with colleagues, difficulties with adapting to virtual meeting technologies, and challenges with self-discipline while WFH were strongly associated with individuals who refused to continuously WFH at all after the pandemic. Individuals holding a strong view against the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic were also largely associated with never choosing WFH during and after the pandemic. For individuals with some prior WFH experiences, the transition to WFH every day in response to the outbreak was much easier, compared to those without prior experiences. Moreover, being forced to WFH during the COVID-19 pandemic positively influences the choice of WFH after the pandemic.

The length and quality of sleep as well as the intensity of perceived stress have an impact on the health of nurses. An appropriate stress coping strategy can reduce the impact of stress and mitigate its negative consequences. Aim: The purpose of this study was to investigate relationships between excessive sleepiness and insomnia in interaction with selected socio-occupational factors and stress coping strategies among nurses. Material and Method: The cross-sectional study was conducted among 448 nurses working in hospitals in Podlasie Province in Poland. Mini-Cope inventory - the polish adaptation of Carver's BriefCope was used for measuring coping with stress. Sleep problems were assessed using the Athens Insomnia Scale and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Results: The most frequent used coping strategies were active strategies (active coping, planning). The least-used were avoidant strategies (behavioral disengagement, substance use). Excessive sleepiness affected 38% of surveyed, while insomnia 33%. Excessive sleepiness was most strongly related with behavioural disengagement (R(2) = 18.6%), substance use (R(2) = 17.5%), humour (R(2) = 13.8%) and denial (R(2) = 12.0%) while insomnia with substance use (R(2) = 17.5%) and self-blame (R(2) = 15.9%). Nurses with tertiary education experiencing sleep problems less frequently used the strategy of humour, behavioural disengagement, substance use and religion than with lower education. Nurses working in interventional wards experiencing excessive sleepiness used the strategy of humour, religion and positive reframing less often than those working in other wards while those suffering from insomnia used the strategy of humour more often than those working in other wards. Conclusions: The implementation of avoidant and support-seeking and emotion-oriented stress coping strategies by nurses were associated with the sleep problems. Tertiary education discourages nurses with sleep problems from using avoidant coping strategies and devoting themselves to religion. Education and improvement of the quality of sleep may prevent nurses from resorting to stress coping strategies that have a detrimental effect on their health and well-being.",2021-06-10,"Kowalczuk, Krystyna; Krajewska-Kułak, Elżbieta; Sobolewski, Marek",Front Psychiatry,,document_parses/pdf_json/23917f7287223de671a67d9e5ee4a64a4c161418.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.660776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34177648/,235382935.0,2021,334

However, the presence of bony structures such as ribs and clavicles can obscure subtle abnormalities, resulting in diagnostic errors. This study aims to build a deep learning (DL)-based bone suppression model that identifies and removes these occluding bony structures in frontal CXRs to assist in reducing errors in radiological interpretation, including DL workflows, related to detecting manifestations consistent with tuberculosis (TB). Several bone suppression models with various deep architectures are trained and optimized using the proposed combined loss function and their performances are evaluated in a cross-institutional test setting using several metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and multiscale structural similarity measure (MS–SSIM). The best-performing model (ResNet–BS) (PSNR = 34.0678; MS–SSIM = 0.9828) is used to suppress bones in the publicly available Shenzhen and Montgomery TB CXR collections. A VGG-16 model is pretrained on a large collection of publicly available CXRs. The CXR-pretrained model is then fine-tuned individually on the non-bone-suppressed and bone-suppressed CXRs of Shenzhen and Montgomery TB CXR collections to classify them as showing normal lungs or TB manifestations. The performances of these models are compared using several performance metrics such as accuracy, the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), analyzed for statistical significance, and their predictions are qualitatively interpreted through class-selective relevance maps (CRMs). It is observed that the models trained on bone-suppressed CXRs (Shenzhen: AUC = 0.9535 ± 0.0186; Montgomery: AUC = 0.9635 ± 0.0106) significantly outperformed (p < 0.05) the models trained on the non-bone-suppressed CXRs (Shenzhen: AUC = 0.8991 ± 0.0268; Montgomery: AUC = 0.8567 ± 0.0870)..

ACE2 and TMPRSS2 co-expression and persistent replicative infection in primitive trophoblast,10.1093/infdis/jiab309,PMC8411376,34293134,no-cc,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection in term placenta is relatively rare. However, growing evidence suggests that susceptibility of the human placenta to infection may vary by gestational age and pathogen. For several viral infections, susceptibility appears to be greatest during early gestation. Infections of the peri-implantation placenta that result in pre-clinical pregnancy loss would typically go undetected. Little is known about the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the peri-implantation human placenta since this time in pregnancy can only be modeled in vitro. METHODS: We used a human embryonic stem cell-derived model of peri-implantation placental development to assess patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcription and protein expression in primitive trophoblast. These molecules are involved in SARS-CoV-2 cell entry and infection. We then infected the same trophoblast cell model with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2, and documented infection dynamics. RESULTS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were transcribed and translated in stem-cell derived trophoblast, with preferential expression in syncytialized cells. These same syncytialized cells supported replicative and persistent infection by SARS-CoV-2, while non-syncytialized trophoblast cells in the same cultures did not. CONCLUSIONS: Co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in early human embryonic stem cell-derived trophoblast and the robust and replicative infection limited to syncytiotrophoblast equivalents support the hypothesis that increased viral susceptibility may be a defining characteristic of primitive trophoblast. Potential implications of these findings for early pregnancy loss deserve further investigation.",2021-07-22,"Zhou, J; Choi, S; Liu, H; Zhang, J; Tian, Y; Edlow, A G; Ezashi, T; Roberts, R M; Ma, W; Schust, D J",J Infect Dis,,document_parses/pdf_json/16cec2a7feb3036adcfd0c2305834a8bef9800d8.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34293134/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab309,236199902.0,2021,223

In this work, we demonstrate a proteome-wide approach to identify virus-host interactions using chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry. We adsorbed tick-borne encephalitis virus onto metabolically-stalled neuroblastoma cells, covalently cross-linked interacting virus-host proteins, and performed limited proteolysis to release primarily the surface-exposed proteins for identification by mass spectrometry. Using the intraviral protein cross-links as an internal control to assess cross-link confidence levels, we identified 22 high confidence unique intraviral cross-links and 59 high confidence unique virus-host protein-protein interactions. The identified host proteins were shown to interact with eight distinct sites on the outer surface of the virus. Notably, we identified an interaction between the substrate-binding domain of heat shock protein family A member 5, an entry receptor for four related flaviviruses, and the hinge region of the viral envelope protein. We also identified host proteins involved in endocytosis, cytoskeletal rearrangement, or located in the cytoskeleton, suggesting that entry mechanisms for tick-borne encephalitis virus could include both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. Additionally, cross-linking of the viral proteins showed that the capsid protein forms dimers within tick-borne encephalitis virus, as previously observed with purified C proteins for other flaviviruses. This method enables the identification and mapping of transient virus-host interactions, under near-physiological conditions, without the need for genetic manipulation. Author summary Tick-borne encephalitis virus is an important human pathogen that can cause severe infection often resulting in life-long neurological complications or even death. As with other viruses, it fully relies on the host cells, and any successful infection starts with interactions between the viral structural proteins and cellular surface proteins. Mapping these interactions is essential both for the fundamental understanding of viral entry mechanisms, and for guiding the design of new antiviral drugs and vaccines. Here, we stabilise the interactions between tick-borne encephalitis virus and human proteins by chemical cross-linking. We then detect the interactions using mass spectrometry and analyse the data to identify protein-protein complexes. We demonstrate that we can visualise the protein interaction interfaces by mapping the cross-linked sites onto the host and viral protein structures. We reveal that there are eight distinct sites on the outer surface of the viral envelope protein that interact with host. Using this approach, we mapped interactions between the tick-borne encephalitis virus envelope protein, and 59 host proteins, identifying a possible new virus receptor. These results highlight the potential of chemical cross-linking coupled with mass spectrometry to identify and map interactions between viral and host proteins.",2021-11-10,"Barrass, Sarah V.; Pulkkinen, Lauri I.

High Alt Med Biol. 22:379–385, 2021. Background: Every year, thousands of people travel to high altitude and experience hypoxemia. At high altitude, the partial pressure of oxygen decreases. The aim of this observational study was to determine if there is a relationship between anthropometric features and basic cardiorespiratory variables, including oxygen saturation (SpO(2)), heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP), following acute exposure to high altitude.

The vasculature is composed of many multifunctional cell subpopulations, each of which is involved in the occurrence and development of cardiovascular diseases. Single-cell transcriptomics captures the full picture of genes expressed within individual cells, identifies rare or de novo cell subpopulations, analyzes single-cell trajectory and stem cell or progenitor cell lineage conversion, and compares healthy tissue and disease-related tissue at single-cell resolution. Single-cell transcriptomics has had a profound effect on the field of cardiovascular research over the past decade, as evidenced by the construction of cardiovascular cell landscape, as well as the clarification of cardiovascular diseases and the mechanism of stem cell or progenitor cell differentiation. The classification and proportion of cell subpopulations in vasculature vary with species, location, genotype, and disease, exhibiting unique gene expression characteristics in organ development, disease progression, and regression. Specific gene markers are expected to be the diagnostic criteria, therapeutic targets, or prognostic indicators of diseases. Therefore, treatment of vascular disease still has lots of potentials to develop.

Molecular understanding of the underlying mechanisms is not complete. Airway epithelial ion transport regulates the homeostasis of airway surface liquid, essential for airway mucosal immunity and lung host defense. Here, air-liquid interface cultures of Calu-3 epithelial cells were basolaterally exposed to physiologically relevant concentrations of ethanol (0, 25, 50 and 100 mM) for 24 hours and adenosine-stimulated ion transport was measured by Ussing chamber. The ethanol exposure reduced the epithelial short-circuit currents (I(SC)) in a dose-dependent manner. The ion currents activated by adenosine were chloride conductance mediated by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-activated chloride channel. Alloxazine, a specific inhibitor for A(2B) adenosine receptor (A(2B)AR), largely abolished the adenosine-stimulated chloride transport, suggesting that A(2B)AR is a major receptor responsible for regulating the chloride transport of the cells. Ethanol significantly reduced intracellular cAMP production upon adenosine stimulation. Moreover, ethanol-suppression of the chloride secretion was able to be restored by cAMP analogs or by inhibitors to block cAMP degradation. These results imply that ethanol exposure dysregulates CFTR-mediated chloride transport in airways by suppression of adenosine-A(2B)AR-cAMP signaling pathway, which might contribute to alcohol-associated lung infections.",2012-03-19,"Raju, Sammeta V.; Wang, Guoshun",PLoS One,,document_parses/pdf_json/b85671451a6132068f92e5da9590cbc9ee5867d5.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3307712/,,2012,192

This work proposes a Learning Automata-based Fireworks Algorithm (LA-FWA) introduced Learning automata (LA) to assign sparks for a better algorithm performance. Sparks are assigned to fireworks according to a state probability vector, which is updated constantly based on feedbacks from an environment so that it accumulates historical information.

We aim to identify risk factors for, and outcomes of, BSI among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We performed a severity matched case-control study (1:1 ratio) nested in a large multicenter prospective cohort of hospitalized adults with COVID-19. Cases with BSI were identified from the cohort database. Controls were matched for age, sex, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. A Cox proportional hazard ratio model was performed. RESULTS: Of 2005 patients, 100 (4.98%) presented 142 episodes of BSI, mainly caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Polymicrobial infection accounted for 23 episodes. The median time from admission to the first episode of BSI was 15 days (IQR 9 - 20), and the most frequent source was catheter-related infection. The characteristics of patients with and without BSI were similar, including the use of tocilizumab, corticosteroids, and combinations. In the multivariate analysis, the use of these immunomodulatory drugs was not associated with an increased risk of BSI. A Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) model showed that after adjusting for the time factor, BSI was associated with a higher in-hospital mortality risk (HR 2.59 [1.65 – 4.07]; <0.001).

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the levels and predictors of anxiety, depression, and stress during the COVID-19 pandemic among frontline healthcare providers in Gurage zonal public hospitals, Southwest Ethiopia, 2020. METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 322 health care providers from November 10–25, 2020 in Gurage zonal health institutions. A simple random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. A pretested self -administered structured questionnaire was used as a data collection technique. The data were entered into the Epi-data version 3.01 and exported to SPSS version 25.0 for analysis. Both descriptive statistics and inferential statistics (chi-square tests) were presented Bivariable and Multivariable logistic regression analyses were made to identify variables having a significant association with the dependent variables. RESULTS: The results of this study had shown that the overall prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress among health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic was 36%, [95% CI = (30.7%- 41.3%)], 25.8% [95% CI = (21.1%- 30.4%)] and 31.4% [95% CI = (26.4%- 36.0%)] respectively. Age, Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR = 7.9], Educational status, [AOR = 3.2], low monthly income [AOR = 1.87], and presence of infected family members [AOR = 3.3] were statistically associated with anxiety.

Methods: We applied an optimized search strategy across the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, PsycINFO, and four Chinese databases, with hand searching supplemented to identify relevant surveys. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were published in peer-reviewed literature and used a validated method to assess the prevalence and risk factors of mental health problems among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Heterogeneity was quantified using Q statistics and the I(2) statistics. The potential causes of heterogeneity were investigated using subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis. Sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the robustness of the results. Results: We pooled and analyzed data from 20 studies comprising 10,886 healthcare workers. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress symptoms, phobia, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, and somatization symptoms was 24.1, 28.6, 44.1, 25.6, 35.0, 16.2, and 10.7%, respectively. Female and nurses had a high prevalence of depression and anxiety. Frontline healthcare workers had a higher prevalence of anxiety and a lower prevalence of depression than the those in the second-line. Furthermore, the proportion of moderate–severe depression and anxiety is higher in the frontline. Additionally, four studies reported on risk factors of mental health problems. Conclusions: In this systematic review, healthcare workers have a relatively high prevalence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress symptoms, phobia, obsessive–compulsive symptoms, and somatization symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, and focus should be on the healthcare workers at high risk of mental problems. Mental health problems in healthcare workers should be taken seriously, and timely screening and appropriate intervention for the high-risk group are highly recommended.

'Vaccine hesitancy' is common in the population and in HCWs, and like COVID-19 itself, hesitancy is more frequent in ethnic minority groups. UK-REACH (United Kingdom Research study into Ethnicity and COVID-19 outcomes) is a large-scale study of COVID-19 in UK HCWs from diverse ethnic backgrounds, which includes measures of vaccine hesitancy. The present study explores predictors of vaccine hesitancy using a 'phenomic approach', considering several hundred questionnaire-based measures. Methods UK-REACH includes a questionnaire study encompassing 12,431 HCWs who were recruited from December 2020 to March 2021 and completed a lengthy online questionnaire (785 raw items; 392 derived measures; 260 final measures). Ethnicity was classified using the Office for National Statistics' five (ONS5) and eighteen (ONS18) categories. Missing data were handled by multiple imputation. Variable selection used the islasso package in R, which provides standard errors so that results from imputations could be combined using Rubin's rules. The data were modelled using path analysis, so that predictors, and predictors of predictors could be assessed. Significance testing used the Bayesian approach of Kass and Raftery, a 'very strong' Bayes Factor of 150, N=12,431, and a Bonferroni correction giving a criterion of p<4.02 x 10-8 for the main regression, and p<3.11 x 10-10 for variables in the path analysis. Results At the first step of the phenomic analysis, six variables were direct predictors of greater vaccine hesitancy: Lower pro-vaccination attitudes; no flu vaccination in 2019-20; pregnancy; higher COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs; younger age; and lower optimism the roll-out of population vaccination. Overall 44 lower variables in total were direct or indirect predictors of hesitancy, with the remaining 215 variables in the phenomic analysis not independently predicting vaccine hesitancy. Key variables for predicting hesitancy were belief in conspiracy theories of COVID-19 infection, and a low belief in vaccines in general. Conspiracy beliefs had two main sets of influences: i) Higher Fatalism, which was influenced a) by high external and chance locus of control and higher need for closure, which in turn were associated with neuroticism, conscientiousness, extraversion and agreeableness; and b) by religion being important in everyday life, and being Muslim. ii) receiving information via social media, not having higher education, and perceiving greater risks to self, the latter being influenced by higher concerns about spreading COVID, greater exposure to COVID-19, and financial concerns. There were indirect effects of ethnicity, mediated by religion. Religion was more important for Pakistani and African HCWs, and less important for White and Chinese groups. Lower age had a direct effect on hesitancy, and age and female sex also had several indirect effects on hesitancy. Conclusions The phenomic approach, coupled with a path analysis revealed a complex network of social, cognitive, and behavioural influences on SARS-Cov-2 vaccine hesitancy from 44 measures, 6 direct and 38 indirect, with the remaining 215 measures not having direct or indirect effects on hesitancy.

This work aims at assessing monthly scale performances of six meteorological data-based methods to predict evapotranspiration by comparing model estimates with observations from six flux tower sites differing for land cover and climate. Three of the proposed methodologies use a potential evapotranspiration approach (Penman, Priestley-Taylor and Blaney-Criddle models) while the additional three an actual evapotranspiration approach (the Advection-Aridity, the Granger and Gray and the Antecedent Precipation Index method). The results show that models efficiency varies from site to site, even though land cover and climate features appear to have some influence. It is difficult to comment on a general accuracy, but an overall moderate better performance of the Advection-Aridity model can be reported within a context where model calibration is not accounted for. If model calibration is further taken into consideration, the Granger and Gray model appears the best performing method but, at the same time, it is also the approach which is mostly affected by the calibration process, and therefore less suited to evapotranspiration prediction tools dealing with a data scarcity context.",2020-08-26,"Mobilia, Mirka; Longobardi, Antonia",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,,document_parses/pdf_json/5d191029c098540d009965438e8f1c84d8957f8e.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974395/,,2020,188

Moreover, the oxidation inherent to thermal spraying in the ambient atmosphere is detrimental to interlamellar bonding formation, which further degrades the performance of thermal spray metal coatings. How to tape out the full potential of spray materials in the form of the coating is a still great challenge to thermal spray coating technology. Facing such challenge, recent efforts have been made to deposit dense metallic coatings with sufficiently bonded lamellae by oxide-free molten droplets through atmospheric plasma spraying. In this paper, the strategies for depositing bulk-like metal coatings will be reviewed. The formation of the bulk-like coating through post-spray treatments is briefly reviewed including post-spray heat treatment and laser remelting following the brief introduction to the features of thermal spray metallic coatings. The effect of the substrate preheating temperature on the splat formation and subsequently the adhesion formation was examined to reveal the dominant limitation of resultant oxide scale. Then, the role of the deposition temperature on the formation of bulk-like metal deposits with neglecting the effect of oxidation during spraying by vacuum plasma spraying practices is shortly presented. The recent progress on the new strategies to develop spread-fusing bonding mechanism and in-situ in-flight deoxidizing mechanism through developing ultra-hot metallic droplets will be introduced. The thermodynamics and kinetics requirements for the in-situ in-flight deoxidizing through deoxidizer elements adding to alloy spray powders for achieving oxide-free molten droplets in the ambient atmosphere are examined. The conditions to develop the spread-fusing mechanism during the spreading of impacting molten metal droplet for metallurgical bonding are presented. It is obvious from this review paper that the realization of two mechanisms depends on both the spray materials design and heating control of in-flight particles. Through the generation of ultra-hot droplets by plasma spraying to achieve oxide-free molten droplets, strategically it will be possible to deposit bulk-like dense metallic coating through spread-fusing of splat surfaces with limited post-spray oxidation. Such strategies will tape out the full potential of coating materials and open up the new application fields for plasma spraying.",2022-01-28,"Li, Chang-Jiu; Luo, Xiao-Tao; Dong, Xin-Yuan; Zhang, Li; Li, Cheng-Xin",J Therm Spray Tech,,document_parses/pdf_json/c1a5000c6bb8f615d5e99fccf6405be92340a80b.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8797376/,,2022,361

By mid-September of 2020, the number of daily new infections in India have crossed 95,000. To facilitate an intuition for the spatio-temporal development of the pandemic and to help resource deployment planning, we analyze and describe how the disease burden almost-predictably shifted from large metropolitan districts to sub-urban districts. Methods. We gathered the publicly available granular data from 186 different districts (equivalent of counties) on their COVID-19 infections and deaths during the 15 April to 31 August 2020 period. These districts presented an active case burden of 559,566 and a cumulative 2,715,656 infections as of August 31. The epidemiological data of these districts was fit to a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered-dead (SAIRD) model and the underlying epidemic parameters for each of these districts during the course of 4 months was estimated. We validated these parameters against known epidemiological characteristic distributions and analyzed them to understand their changes in space-time during the pandemic. Findings. The center of the burden of the current-active infections which on May 15 was in the large metro districts with most international access shifted continuously and smoothly shifted towards districts which could be accessed by domestic airports and by trains. A linear trend-analysis showed a continuous improvement in most epidemic parameters consistently across the districts with four categories of accessibility from an international travel perspective - large metro, metro, urban and sub-urban districts. The reproduction numbers improved from 1.77{+/-}0.58 on May 15 to 1.07{+/-} 0.13 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0001053); and from 1.58{+/-}0.39 on May 15 to 0.94{+/-}0.11 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.0067). The recovery rate per infected person per day improved from 0.0581{+/-}0.009 on May 15 to 0.091{+/-}0.010 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.26.10^{-12}); and from 0.059{+/-}0.011 on May 15 to 0.100{+/-}0.010 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.12.10{-16}). The death rate of symptomatic individuals which includes the case-fatality-rate as well as the time from symptoms to death, consistently decreased from 0.0025{+/-}0.0014 on May 15 to 0.0013{+/-}0.0003 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0010); and from 0.0018{+/-}0.0008 on May 15 to 0.0014{+/-}0.0003 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.2789. Interpretation. As the daily infections continue to rise at a national level, it is important to notice a `local-flattening' in larger metro districts, and a shift of the pandemic-burden towards smaller sized districts in a clear hierarchical fashion of accessibility from an international travel perspective. The pandemic burden shifting towards remotely accessible regions, with possibly lesser health care facilities, is a call for attention to the re-organization of resources.",2020-09-29,"Ansumali, S.; Kumar, A.; Agrawal, S.; Shashank, H.

The present research aims at investigating the therapeutic potential of Chloroquine and its potent derivative Hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. At the same time screening was performed for some chemically synthesized derivatives of Chloroquine and compared their binding efficacy with chemically synthesized Chloroquine derivatives through in silico approaches. For the purpose of the study, some essential viral proteins and enzymes were selected that are implicated in SARS-CoV-2 replication and multiplication as putative drug targets. Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, and some of their chemically synthesized derivatives, taken from earlier published studies were selected as drug molecules. We have conducted molecular docking and related studies between Chloroquine and its derivatives and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, and the findings show that both Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine can bind to specific structural and non-structural proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with different efficiencies. Our current study also shows that some of the chemically synthesized Chloroquine derivatives can also potentially inhibit various SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins by binding to them and concomitantly effectively disrupting the active site of these proteins. These findings bring into light another possible mechanism of action of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine and also pave the way for further drug repurposing and remodeling.

Currently, no vaccine or effective treatment exists for RSV. The RSV G glycoprotein mediates viral attachment to cells and contributes to pathogenesis by modulating host immunity through interactions with the human chemokine receptor CX3CR1. Antibodies targeting the RSV G central conserved domain are protective in both prophylactic and post-infection animal models. Here we describe the crystal structure of the broadly-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody 3G12 bound to the RSV G central conserved domain. Antibody 3G12 binds to a conformational epitope composed of highly conserved residues, explaining its broad neutralization activity. Surprisingly, RSV G complexed with 3G12 adopts a distinct conformation not observed in previously described RSV G-antibody structures. Comparison to other structures reveals that the RSV G central conserved domain is flexible and can adopt multiple conformations in the regions flanking the cysteine noose. We also show that restriction of RSV G flexibility with a proline mutation abolishes binding to antibody 3G12 but not antibody 3D3, which recognizes a different conformation of RSV G. Our studies provide new insights for rational vaccine design, indicating the importance of preserving both the global structural integrity of antigens and local conformational flexibility at antigenic sites, which may elicit a more diverse antibody response and broader protection against infection and disease.IMPORTANCE Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe respiratory infections in infants, young children, and the elderly, and currently no licensed vaccine exists. In this study, we describe the crystal structure of the RSV surface glycoprotein G in complex with a broadly-neutralizing human monoclonal antibody.

The pandemic presented new barriers to pediatric vaccinations. Furthermore, the development of COVID-19 vaccines has complicated factors underlying vaccine hesitancy. We performed a cross-sectional mobile phone-based survey at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles querying parents regarding perspectives on vaccines before and during the pandemic. Our primary aim was to understand the impact of the pandemic on routine childhood vaccine hesitancy. Secondarily, we examined intent to vaccinate, COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, and key contributing demographic factors. Among 252 participants, we found overall increased childhood vaccine hesitancy (p = 0.006), increased risk perception (p = 0.006), and unchanged vaccine confidence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased hesitancy did not translate into decreased intent to vaccinate with routine childhood vaccines or influenza vaccines. During the pandemic, households with higher income (50–99 K, > 100 K) correlated with decreased routine childhood vaccine hesitancy, while Hispanic ethnicity and African American race had increased risk perception. For COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, households with higher income (> 100 K) correlated with decreased hesitancy, while non-White ethnicity and race had increased risk perception. We found that routine childhood vaccine hesitancy increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly due to increased risk perception.

Objectives We sought to determine the association between CRD (including disease overlap) and the clinical outcomes of COVID-19. Methods Data of diagnoses, comorbidities, medications, laboratory results and clinical outcomes were extracted from the national COVID-19 reporting system. CRD was diagnosed based on ICD-10 codes. The primary endpoint was the composite outcome of needing invasive ventilation, admission to intensive care unit, or death within 30 days after hospitalization. The secondary endpoint was death within 30 days after hospitalization. Results We included 39,420 laboratory-confirmed patients from the electronic medical records as of May 6th, 2020. Any CRD and CRD overlap was present in 2.8% and 0.2% of patients, respectively. COPD was most common (56.6%), followed by bronchiectasis (27.9%) and asthma (21.7%).

The NO(2) sensors based on traditional materials have limitations of high-temperature requirements, slow recovery, and performance degradation under harsh environmental conditions. These limitations of traditional materials are forcing the scientific community to discover future alternative NO(2) sensitive materials. Molybdenum disulfide (MoS(2)) has emerged as a potential candidate for developing next-generation NO(2) gas sensors. MoS(2) has a large surface area for NO(2) molecules adsorption with controllable morphologies, facile integration with other materials and compatibility with internet of things (IoT) devices. The aim of this review is to provide a detailed overview of the fabrication of MoS(2) chemiresistance sensors in terms of devices (resistor and transistor), layer thickness, morphology control, defect tailoring, heterostructure, metal nanoparticle doping, and through light illumination. Moreover, the experimental and theoretical aspects used in designing MoS(2)-based NO(2) sensors are also discussed extensively. Finally, the review concludes the challenges and future perspectives to further enhance the gas-sensing performance of MoS(2). Understanding and addressing these issues are expected to yield the development of highly reliable and industry standard chemiresistance NO(2) gas sensors for environmental monitoring.

Here, the presence of ACE2 in extracellular vesicles (EVs) is reported and the EV‐ACE2 levels are determined by protein palmitoylation. The Cys141 and Cys498 residues on ACE2 are S‐palmitoylated by zinc finger DHHC‐Type Palmitoyltransferase 3 (ZDHHC3) and de‐palmitoylated by acyl protein thioesterase 1 (LYPLA1), which is critical for the membrane‐targeting of ACE2 and their EV secretion. Importantly, by fusing the S‐palmitoylation‐dependent plasma membrane (PM) targeting sequence with ACE2, EVs enriched with ACE2 on their surface (referred to as PM‐ACE2‐EVs) are engineered. It is shown that PM‐ACE2‐EVs can bind to the SARS‐CoV‐2 S‐RBD with high affinity and block its interaction with cell surface ACE2 in vitro. PM‐ACE2‐EVs show neutralization potency against pseudotyped and authentic SARS‐CoV‐2 in human ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic mice, efficiently block viral load of authentic SARS‐CoV‐2, and thus protect host against SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced lung inflammation.

METHODS The MiSW pilot program was administered jointly by a community college and a university and consisted of a 20-week virtual course followed by a nine-month mentored work placement in their communities. RESULTS The MiSW pilot program was delivered successfully and eleven of thirteen participants received a certificate from a community college. MiSWs provided culturally and linguistically appropriate care to women, infants and families in their respective communities. MiSWs provided doula support in their communities - a first for our region since the policy of forced evacuation for birth was implemented. MiSWs developed a community of practice for ongoing education as well as to support each other in their work. CONCLUSION The MiSW pilot program demonstrated that it is possible to provide a virtual training program and then to provide continued virtual mentorship as the participants work in their First Nations' communities.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) are two common and indistinguishable types of cardiomyopathy. RESULTS: Here, a systematic multi-omics integration approach was proposed to identify cardiomyopathy-related core genes that could distinguish normal, DCM and ICM samples using cardiomyopathy expression profile data based on a human metabolic network. First, according to the differentially expressed genes between different states (DCM/ICM and normal, or DCM and ICM) of samples, three sets of initial modules were obtained from the human metabolic network. Two permutation tests were used to evaluate the significance of the Pearson correlation coefficient difference score of the initial modules, and three candidate modules were screened out. Then, a cardiomyopathy risk module that was significantly related to DCM and ICM was determined according to the significance of the module score based on Markov random field. Finally, based on the shortest path between cardiomyopathy known genes, 13 core genes related to cardiomyopathy were identified. These core genes were enriched in pathways and functions significantly related to cardiomyopathy and could distinguish between samples of different states. CONCLUSION: The identified core genes might serve as potential biomarkers of cardiomyopathy.

However, adversaries can launch various attacks on the communication network and the hardware/firmware to introduce false data or cause data unavailability to the automatic medication system endangering the patient's life. In this paper, we propose SHChecker, a novel threat analysis framework that integrates machine learning and formal analysis capabilities to identify potential attacks and corresponding effects on an IoMT-based SHS. Our framework can provide us with all potential attack vectors, each representing a set of sensor measurements to be altered, for an SHS given a specific set of attack attributes, allowing us to realize the system's resiliency, thus the insight to enhance the robustness of the model.

We aimed to quantify this backlog nationally for England and assess how various interventions might mitigate the backlog. METHODS: We did a national analysis of data for colonoscopies, flexible sigmoidoscopies, and gastroscopies from National Health Service (NHS) trusts in NHS England's Monthly Diagnostic Waiting Times and Activity dataset. Trusts were excluded if monthly data were incomplete. To estimate the potential backlog, we used linear logistic regression to project the cumulative deficit between actual procedures performed and expected procedures, based on historical pre-pandemic trends. We then made further estimations of the change to the backlog under three scenarios: recovery to a set level of capacity, ranging from 90% to 130%; further disruption to activity (eg, second pandemic wave); or introduction of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) triaging. FINDINGS: We included data from Jan 1, 2018, to Oct 31, 2020, from 125 NHS trusts. 10 476 endoscopy procedures were done in April, 2020, representing 9·5% of those done in April, 2019 (n=110 584), before recovering to 105 716 by October, 2020 (84·5% of those done in October, 2019 [n=125 072]). Recovering to 100% capacity on the current trajectory would lead to a projected backlog of 162 735 (95% CI 143 775–181 695) colonoscopies, 119 025 (107 398–130 651) flexible sigmoidoscopies, and 194 087 (172 564–215 611) gastroscopies in January, 2021, attributable to the pandemic. Increasing capacity to 130% would still take up to June, 2022, to eliminate the backlog. A further 2-month interruption would add an extra 15·4%, a 4-month interruption would add an extra 43·8%, and a 6-month interruption would add an extra 82·5% to the potential backlog. FIT triaging of cases that are found to have greater than 10 μg haemoglobin per g would reduce colonoscopy referrals to around 75% of usual levels, with the backlog cleared in early 2022. INTERPRETATION: Our work highlights the impact of the pandemic on endoscopy services nationally. Even with mitigation measures, it could take much longer than a year to eliminate the pandemic-related backlog. Urgent action is required by key stakeholders (ie, individual NHS trusts, Clinical Commissioning Groups, British Society of Gastroenterology, and NHS England) to tackle the backlog and prevent delays to patient management.

Additionally, in indoor environments, such as houses or hospitals, conidia are frequently detected too. Hospital-acquired aspergillosis is usually associated with airborne fungal contamination of the hospital air, especially after building construction events. A. fumigatus strain typing can fulfill many needs both in clinical settings and otherwise. The high incidence of aspergillosis in COVID patients from our hospital, made us wonder if they were hospital-acquired aspergillosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the hospital environment was the source of aspergillosis infection in CAPA patients, admitted to the Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, during the first and second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, or whether it was community-acquired aspergillosis before admission. During 2020, sixty-nine A. fumigatus strains were collected for this study: 59 were clinical isolates from 28 COVID-19 patients, and 10 strains were environmentally isolated from seven hospital rooms and intensive care units. A diagnosis of pulmonary aspergillosis was based on the ECCM/ISHAM criteria. Strains were genotyped by PCR amplification and sequencing of a panel of four hypervariable tandem repeats within exons of surface protein coding genes (TRESPERG). A total of seven genotypes among the 10 environmental strains and 28 genotypes among the 59 clinical strains were identified. Genotyping revealed that only one environmental A. fumigatus from UCI 5 (box 54) isolated in October (30 October 2020) and one A. fumigatus isolated from a COVID-19 patient admitted in Pneumology (Room 532-B) in November (24 November 2020) had the same genotype, but there was a significant difference in time and location. There was also no relationship in time and location between similar A. fumigatus genotypes of patients. The global A. fumigatus, environmental and clinical isolates, showed a wide diversity of genotypes. To our knowledge, this is the first study monitoring and genotyping A. fumigatus isolates obtained from hospital air and COVID-19 patients, admitted with aspergillosis, during one year. Our work shows that patients do not acquire A. fumigatus in the hospital. This proves that COVID-associated aspergillosis in our hospital is not a nosocomial infection, but supports the hypothesis of “community aspergillosis” acquisition outside the hospital, having the home environment (pandemic period at home) as the main suspected focus of infection.",2022-03-19,"Peláez-García de la Rasilla, Teresa; González-Jiménez, Irene; Fernández-Arroyo, Andrea; Roldán, Alejandra; Carretero-Ares, Jose Luis; García-Clemente, Marta; Telenti-Asensio, Mauricio; García-Prieto, Emilio; Martínez-Suarez, Mar; Vázquez-Valdés, Fernando; Melón-García, Santiago; Caminal-Montero, Luis; Fernández-Simón, Inmaculada; Mellado, Emilia; Sánchez-Núñez, María Luisa",J Fungi (Basel),,document_parses/pdf_json/ab1d4188809a1f0317dfca011b2eab504509d220.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35330318/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jof8030316,247601560.0,2022,378

Standard methods for assessing autochthonous (local) transmission risk make either indirect estimates based on ecological suitability or direct estimates only after local cases accumulate. However, an overlooked source of epidemiological data that can meaningfully inform risk assessments prior to outbreak emergence is the absence of transmission by imported cases. Here, we present a method for updating a priori ecological estimates of transmission risk using real-time importation data. We demonstrate our method using Zika importation and transmission data from Texas in 2016, a high-risk region in the southern United States. Our updated risk estimates are lower than previously reported, with only six counties in Texas likely to sustain a Zika epidemic, and consistent with the number of autochthonous cases detected in 2017.

These services largely breakdowns due to restrictions on border movements, confined travel and transportation services, a decline in international tourists’ visitation, nationwide lockdowns, and maintaining social distancing in the population. Although these measures are highly needed to contain coronavirus, it decreases economic and financial activities in a country, which requires smart solutions to globally subsidize the services sector. The study used different COVID-19 measures, and its resulting impact on the services industry by using world aggregated data from 1975 through 2020. The study benefited from the Keynesian theory of aggregate demand that remains provided a solution to minimize economic shocks through stringent or liberalizing economic policies. The COVID-19 pandemic is more severe than the financial shocks of 2018 that affected almost all sectors of the globalized world, particularly the services sector, which has been severally affected by COVID-19; it is a high time to revisit economic policies to control pandemic recession. The study used quantiles regression and innovation accounting matrix to obtain ex-ante and ex-post analysis. The quantile regression estimates show that causes of death by communicable diseases, including COVID-19, mainly decline the share of services value added to the global GDP at different quantiles distribution. In contrast, word-of-mouth helps to prevent it from the transmission channel of coronavirus plague through information sharing among the general masses. The control of food prices and managing physical distancing reduces suspected coronavirus cases; however, it negatively affects the services sector’s value share. The smart lockdown and sound economic activities do not decrease coronavirus cases, while they support increasing the percentage of the services sector to the global GDP. The innovation accounting matrix suggested that smart lockdown, managing physical distancing, effective price control, and sound financial activities will help to reduce coronavirus cases that will further translate into increased services value-added for the next ten years. The social distancing will exert a more considerable variance error shock to the services industry, which indicates the viability of these measures to contained novel coronavirus over a time horizon.

Early detection of COVID-19 positive patients and timely isolation of the patients are essential to prevent its spread. Chest X-ray images of COVID-19 patients often show the characteristics of multifocality, bilateral hairy glass turbidity, patchy network turbidity, etc. It is crucial to design a method to automatically identify COVID-19 from chest X-ray images to help diagnosis and prognosis. Existing studies for the classification of COVID-19 rarely consider the role of attention mechanisms on the classification of chest X-ray images and fail to capture the cross-channel and cross-spatial interrelationships in multiple scopes. This paper proposes a multi-kernel-size spatial-channel attention method to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. Our proposed method consists of three stages. The first stage is feature extraction. The second stage contains two parallel multi-kernel-size attention modules: multi-kernel-size spatial attention and multi-kernel-size channel attention. The two modules capture the cross-channel and cross-spatial interrelationships in multiple scopes using multiple 1D and 2D convolutional kernels of different sizes to obtain channel and spatial attention feature maps. The third stage is the classification module. We integrate the chest X-ray images from three public datasets: COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset Initiative, ActualMed COVID-19 Chest X-ray Dataset Initiative, and COVID-19 radiography database for evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance of COVID-19 detection and achieves an accuracy of 98.2%.",2021-06-04,"Fan, Yuqi; Liu, Jiahao; Yao, Ruixuan; Yuan, Xiaohui",Pattern Recognit,,document_parses/pdf_json/12a8aa9c7efa708bfedf51eaf37a56942ddf87da.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2021.108055; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0031320321002429; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320321002429?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34103766/,235337777.0,2021,238

In the present study we examined pathogen‐free, SCAD deficient BALB/cByJ mice and control BALB/cBy mice for biochemical and tissue changes following fasting or salicylate challenge. We observed mitochondrial swelling and microvesicular fatty changes in hepatocytes in mutant mice, especially severe following a fast. However, fasting did not alter their blood ammonia and there was no apparent clinical disease. Similarly, salicylates did not produce disease in the BALB/cByJ mice.

However, to date, little has been reported about the effects of this infection on the thyroid gland. Femoral head necrosis and low serum triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels, commonly found in patients with SARS, raise the possibility of thyroid dysfunction. We have undertaken this study to evaluate for any potential injury to the thyroid gland caused by SARS on tissue samples obtained from 5 SARS autopsies. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUPT nick end–labeling assay was performed to identify apoptotic cells. The follicular epithelium was found to be damaged with large numbers of cells exfoliated into the follicle. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUPT nick end–labeling assay demonstrated many cells undergoing apoptosis. Follicular architecture was altered and showed distortion, dilatation, and collapse. No distinct calcitonin-positive cells were detectable in the SARS thyroids. In conclusion, both parafollicular and follicular cells were injured.

However, the role of severe COVID-19 in the magnitude of muscle wasting and functionality in the acute critical disease is unknown. Objective: To perform a prospective characterization to evaluate the skeletal muscle mass and functional performance in intensive care patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: Thirty-two critically ill patients (93.8% male; age: 64.1 ± 12.6 years) with the diagnosis of the severe COVID-19 were prospectively recruited within 24 to 72 h following intensive care unit (ICU) admission, from April 2020 to October 2020, at Hospital Sírio-Libanês in Brazil. Patients were recruited if older than 18 years old, diagnosis of severe COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR, ICU stay and absence of limb amputation. Muscle wasting was determined through an ultrasound measurement of the rectus femoris cross-sectional area, the thickness of the anterior compartment of the quadriceps muscle (rectus femoris and vastus intermedius), and echogenicity. The peripheral muscle strength was assessed with a handgrip test. The functionality parameter was determined through the ICU mobility scale (IMS) and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). All evaluations were performed on days 1 and 10. Results: There were significant reductions in the rectus femoris cross-section area (−30.1% [95% IC, −26.0% to −34.1%]; P < 0.05), thickness of the anterior compartment of the quadriceps muscle (−18.6% [95% IC, −14.6% to 22.5%]; P < 0.05) and handgrip strength (−22.3% [95% IC, 4.7% to 39.9%]; P < 0.05) from days 1 to 10.

Although most young individuals suffer from mild to moderate disease, there are concerns of long-term adverse health effects. The impact of COVID-19 disease and to which extent population-level immunity against SARS-CoV-2 exist in young adults remain unclear. Objective To conduct a population-based study on humoral and cellular immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and explore COVID-19 disease characteristics in young adults. Methods We invited participants from the Swedish BAMSE birth cohort (age 24-27 years) to take part in a COVID-19 follow-up. From 980 participants (October 2020-June 2021), we here present data on SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific IgM, IgA and IgG titres measured by ELISA and on symptoms and epidemiological factors associated with seropositivity. Further, SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B- and T-cell responses were detected for a subpopulation (n=108) by ELISpot and Fluorospot. Results 28.4% of subjects were seropositive of which 18.4% were IgM single positive. One in seven seropositive subjects were asymptomatic. Seropositivity associated with use of public transport, but not with sex, asthma, rhinitis, IgE-sensitization, smoking or BMI. In a subset of representative samples, 20.7% and 35.0% had detectable SARS-CoV-2 specific B- and T-cell responses, respectively. B- and T-cell memory responses were clearly associated with seropositivity, but T-cell responses were also detected in 17.2% of seronegative subjects.

Long cytosolic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is recognized by MDA5. The ATPase activity of MDA5 contributes to its dsRNA binding selectivity. Mutations that reduce RNA selectivity can cause autoimmune disease. Here, we show how the disease-associated MDA5 variant M854K perturbs MDA5-dsRNA recognition. M854K MDA5 constitutively activates interferon signaling in the absence of exogenous RNA. M854K MDA5 lacks ATPase activity and binds more tightly to synthetic Alu:Alu dsRNA. CryoEM structures MDA5-dsRNA filaments at different stages of ATP hydrolysis show that the K854 side-chain forms polar bonds that constrain the conformation of MDA5 subdomains, disrupting key steps in the ATPase cycle-RNA footprint expansion and helical twist modulation. The M854K mutation inhibits ATP-dependent RNA proofreading via a novel allosteric mechanism, allowing MDA5 to form signaling complexes on endogenous RNAs.

The enormous burden of caregiving can decrease a parent’s ability to provide care, impacting the health of the child, the parents, and overall family functioning. To manage these challenges, these parents report the need for mental health care for themselves or their children, but many families with need go without care. Comprehensive knowledge about barriers to family mental health care for families of CSHCN is lacking. This study examines data from the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (2005/2006 and 2009/2010) to estimate time-specific, population-based prevalence of fourteen specific barriers to family mental health services and identifies risk factors for experiencing barriers to care for families of CSHCN. Among all CSHCN, cost barriers (33.5%) and lack of insurance (15.9%) were the most commonly reported obstacles to service access in 2005 and 2009, followed by inconvenient service times (12.3%), and locations (8.7%). Reports of these barriers increased significantly from 2005 to 2009. All types of barriers to family mental health services were reported significantly more frequently by CSHCN with EBDPs than by those without. CSHCN’s race, insurance, and parent education and income levels were factors associated with cost barriers to family mental health care.

METHODS: We developed a high-volume air sampler method that used a household vacuum cleaner with surgical face masks serving as sample filters. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was harvested from these filters and analysed by polymerase chain reaction. Fog experiments were performed to visualize the airflow around the air sampler. We acquired air samples in close proximity of infected individuals, with or without wearing facemasks, in their homes. We also obtained environmental air samples remote from these infected individuals and samples near patients in the ICU undergoing potential aerosol-generating medical procedures. FINDINGS: Wearing a face mask resulted in a delayed and reduced flow of the fog into the air sampler. Face masks worn by infected individuals were found to contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 71% of cases. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in air samples regardless of mask experiments. The proportion of positive air samples was higher in the homes (29/41; 70.7%) than in the ICU (4/17; 23.5%) (p<0.01).

We proposed a DNN to perform lung segmentation and classification, stacking a segmentation module (U-Net), an original intermediate module and a classification module (DenseNet201). To evaluate generalization, we tested the DNN with an external dataset (from distinct localities) and used Bayesian inference to estimate probability distributions of performance metrics. Our DNN achieved 0.917 AUC on the external test dataset, and a DenseNet without segmentation, 0.906. Bayesian inference indicated mean accuracy of 76.1% and [0.695, 0.826] 95% HDI (high density interval, which concentrates 95% of the metric's probability mass) with segmentation and, without segmentation, 71.7% and [0.646, 0.786]. We proposed a novel DNN evaluation technique, using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and Brixia scores. LRP heatmaps indicated that areas where radiologists found strong COVID-19 symptoms and attributed high Brixia scores are the most important for the stacked DNN classification. External validation showed smaller accuracies than internal, indicating difficulty in generalization, which segmentation improves.

Comparing high-to-moderate consumption, there was further increased risk of caries (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.17-1.99; DMFT WMD = 1.16, 95% CI: -0.59-2.91) and erosion (OR = 3.09, 95% CI: 1.37-6.97). A dose-response gradient and high certainty of evidence was observed for caries. CONCLUSIONS Increasing SSB consumption is associated with increased risk of dental caries and erosion. Studies were cross-sectional, hence temporality could not be established, but the positive dose-response suggests this relationship is likely to be causal. These findings illustrate the potential benefits to oral health of policies that reduce SSB consumption, including sugar taxation.",2020-08-23,"Valenzuela, Maria Josefina; Waterhouse, Beverley; Aggarwal, Vishal R; Bloor, Karen; Doran, Tim",European journal of public health,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckaa147; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830237/,221285818.0,2020,257

In this critical review, we discussed the advantages and limitations in the implementation of salivary diagnostic platforms of COVID-19. The diagnostic test of COVID-19 by invasive nasopharyngeal collection is uncomfortable for patients and requires specialized training of healthcare professionals in order to obtain an appropriate collection of samples. Additionally, these professionals are in close contact with infected patients or suspected cases of COVID-19, leading to an increased contamination risk for frontline healthcare workers. Although there is a colossal demand for novel diagnostic platforms with non-invasive and self-collection samples of COVID-19, the implementation of the salivary platforms has not been implemented for extensive scale testing. Up to date, several cross-section and clinical trial studies published in the last 12 months support the potential of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva as a biomarker for COVID-19, providing a self-collection, non-invasive, safe, and comfortable procedure. Therefore, the salivary diagnosis is suitable to protect healthcare professionals and other frontline workers and may encourage patients to get tested due to its advantages over the current invasive methods. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva was substantial also in patients with a negative nasopharyngeal swab, indicating the presence of false negative results. Furthermore, we expect that salivary diagnostic devices for COVID-19 will continue to be used with austerity without excluding traditional gold standard specimens to detect SARS-CoV-2.",2021-05-21,"Caixeta, Douglas Carvalho; Oliveira, Stephanie Wutke; Cardoso-Sousa, Leia; Cunha, Thulio Marquez; Goulart, Luiz Ricardo; Martins, Mario Machado; Marin, Lina Maria; Jardim, Ana Carolina Gomes; Siqueira, Walter Luiz; Sabino-Silva, Robinson",Front Public Health,,document_parses/pdf_json/a0817a8bdc782bc9eb67d4a65eb07131733127e4.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34150692/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.589564,234795608.0,2021,234

Whether thyroid function independently correlates with lymphocyte counts (LYM) remains to be elucidated. METHODS: We included consecutive adults without known thyroid disorder admitted to Queen Mary Hospital for COVID-19 from July 2020 to April 2021 who had thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3) and LYM measured on admission. RESULTS: A total of 541 patients were included. Median LYM was 1.22 x 10(9)/L, with 36.0% of the cohort lymphopenic. 83 patients (15.4%) had abnormal thyroid function tests (TFTs), mostly non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). Patients with lymphopenia had lower TSH, fT4 and fT3 levels than those without. Multivariable stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that both TSH (standardized beta 0.160, p<0.001) and fT3 (standardized beta 0.094, p=0.023), but not fT4, remained independently correlated with LYM, in addition to age, SARS-CoV-2 viral load, C-reactive protein levels, coagulation profile, sodium levels and more severe clinical presentations. Among the 40 patients who had reassessment of TFTs and LYM after discharge, at a median of 9 days from admission, there were significant increases in TSH (p=0.031), fT3 (p<0.001) and LYM (p<0.001). Furthermore, patients who had both lymphopenia and NTIS were more likely to deteriorate compared to those who only had either one alone, and those without lymphopenia or NTIS (p for trend <0.001).

METHODS: We obtained 1,280,806 records from adult patients with COVID-19 and DM to analyze the probability of COVID-19, development of COVID-19 pneumonia, hospitalization, intubation, admission to the Intensive Care Unit [ICU] and case-fatality rates [CFR]. Variables were controlled by age, sex and altitude of residence to calculate adjusted prevalence and prevalence ratios. RESULTS: Patients with DM had a 21.8% higher prevalence of COVID-19 and an additional 120.2% higher prevalence of COVID-19 pneumonia. The adjusted prevalence was also higher for these outcomes as well as for hospitalization, intubation and ICU admission. COVID-19 and pneumonia patients with DM had a 97.0% and 19.4% higher CFR, respectively. With increasing altitudes, the probability of being a confirmed COVID-19 case and the development of pneumonia decreased along CFR for patients with and without DM. However, COVID-19 patients with DM were more likely to require intubation when residing at high altitude. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that patients with DM have a higher probability of being a confirmed COVID-19 case and developing pneumonia. Higher altitude had a protective relationship against SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, it may be associated with more severe cases in patients with and without DM. High altitude decreases CFR for all COVID-19 patients.

However, the emergence of several variants of concern and reports of declining antibody levels have raised uncertainty about the durability of immune memory following vaccination. In this study, we longitudinally profiled both antibody and cellular immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 naïve and recovered individuals from pre-vaccine baseline to 6 months post-mRNA vaccination. Antibody and neutralizing titers decayed from peak levels but remained detectable in all subjects at 6 months post-vaccination. Functional memory B cell responses, including those specific for the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants, were also efficiently generated by mRNA vaccination and continued to increase in frequency between 3 and 6 months post-vaccination. Notably, most memory B cells induced by mRNA vaccines were capable of cross-binding variants of concern, and B cell receptor sequencing revealed significantly more hypermutation in these RBD variant-binding clones compared to clones that exclusively bound wild-type RBD. Moreover, the percent of variant cross-binding memory B cells was higher in vaccinees than individuals who recovered from mild COVID-19. mRNA vaccination also generated antigen-specific CD8+ T cells and durable memory CD4+ T cells in most individuals, with early CD4+ T cell responses correlating with humoral immunity at later timepoints. These findings demonstrate robust, multi-component humoral and cellular immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 and current variants of concern for at least 6 months after mRNA vaccination. Finally, we observed that boosting of pre-existing immunity with mRNA vaccination in SARS-CoV-2 recovered individuals primarily increased antibody responses in the short-term without significantly altering antibody decay rates or long-term B and T cell memory. Together, this study provides insights into the generation and evolution of vaccine-induced immunity to SARS-CoV-2, including variants of concern, and has implications for future booster strategies.",2021-08-23,"Goel, Rishi R.; Painter, Mark M.; Apostolidis, Sokratis A.; Mathew, Divij; Meng, Wenzhao; Rosenfeld, Aaron M.; Lundgreen, Kendall A.; Reynaldi, Arnold; Khoury, David S.; Pattekar, Ajinkya; Gouma, Sigrid; Kuri-Cervantes, Leticia; Hicks, Philip; Dysinger, Sarah; Hicks, Amanda; Sharma, Harsh; Herring, Sarah; Korte, Scott; Baxter, Amy E.; Oldridge, Derek A.; Giles, Josephine R.; Weirick, Madison E.; McAllister, Christopher M.; Awofolaju, Moses; Tanenbaum, Nicole; Drapeau, Elizabeth M.; Dougherty, Jeanette; Long, Sherea; D’Andrea, Kurt; Hamilton, Jacob T.; McLaughlin, Maura; Williams, Justine C.; Adamski, Sharon; Kuthuru, Oliva; Frank, Ian; Betts, Michael R.; Vella, Laura A.; Grifoni, Alba; Weiskopf, Daniela; Sette, Alessandro; Hensley, Scott E.; Davenport, Miles P.; Bates, Paul; Luning Prak, Eline T.; Greenplate, Allison R.; Wherry, E.

Data on the pandemic daily infections from the Arabian Gulf countries from 2020/03/24 to 2021/05/20 are fitted to each model and a statistical analysis is conducted to assess their short-term prediction accuracy. The results show that state space model predictions are more accurate with notably smaller root mean square errors than the deep learning forecasting method. The results also indicate that the poorer forecast performance of long short-term memory neural networks occurs in particular when health surveillance data are characterized by high fluctuations of the daily infection records and frequent occurrences of abrupt changes. One important result of this study is the possible relationship between data complexity and forecast accuracy with different models as suggested in the entropy analysis.

AIM: This study aimed to assess the levels of depression among bachelor and master university students (nurses/midwives) and their family members’ during the quarantine period of COVID‐19 pandemic. METHOD: A cross‐sectional study was conducted in Vlora University, Albania. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ‐9) was used. Institutional e‐mails of all active students were used for their recruitment. RESULTS: In total, 863 students and 249 family members participated in the study. The mean PHQ‐9 score was 6.220 (SD=5.803) and 6.280 (SD=5.857) for students and family members, respectively. Being unsatisfied with COVID‐19 prevention measures, beliefs that COVID‐19 infection and quarantine process can cause problems on their health status were the key factors for students to be screened positive for mental problems in multiple regression analysis. For parents, the last two factors were found to contribute significantly. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that quarantine measures have a significant impact on the levels of depression among both university students and their family members. Broader population studies are necessary to safeguard these results. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Provision of mental health services during the quarantine period is of paramount significance.

During the initial spreading of the virus in China, we demonstrated the ensemble Kalman filter performed well as a short-term predictor of the daily cases reported in Wuhan City. Second, we used an individual-level network-based model to reconstruct the epidemic dynamics in Hubei Province at its early stage and examine the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the epidemic spreading with various scenarios. Our simulation results show that without continued control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province could have become persistent. Only by continuing to decrease the infection rate through 1) protective measures and 2) social distancing can the actual epidemic trajectory that happened in Hubei Province be reconstructed in simulation. Finally, we simulate the COVID-19 transmission with non-Markovian processes and show how these models produce different epidemic trajectories, compared to those obtained with Markov processes. Since recent studies show that COVID-19 epidemiological parameters do not follow exponential distributions leading to Markov processes, future works need to focus on non-Markovian models to better capture the COVID-19 spreading trajectories. In addition, shortening the infectious period via early case identification and isolation can slow the epidemic spreading significantly.",2020-03-30,"Yang, Qihui; Yi, Chunlin; Vajdi, Aram; Cohnstaedt, Lee W; Wu, Hongyu; Guo, Xiaolong; Scoglio, Caterina M",,,document_parses/pdf_json/26a2d4b805cdb48bccb4d640da82fa4c4d15c7c4.json,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.27.20045625,216414594.0,2020,201

One form of e-learning is the Flipped Classroom (FC). FC courses, however, are still heavily dependent on the commitment of individual teachers. Repeatable descriptions of approaches or institutionalized support are rare. The high amount of work involved discourages many teachers from using FCs. Strategic course development should therefore be conducted collaboratively by several stakeholders. Change management approaches offer a solution to deal with the integration of strategies for change and consider all stakeholder groups. This paper aims to combine an FC process model and a change management approach to include all stakeholders.

METHODS We conducted a decedent cohort study of adults deceased at the ED of a Portuguese teaching hospital in 2016. PC needs were identified using the National Hospice Organization terminality criteria and comorbidities measurement by the Charlson's Index. RESULTS 384 adults died at the ED (median age 82 (IQR 72-89) years) and 78.4% (95% CI 73.9% to 82.2%) presented PC needs. Only 3.0% (n=9) were referred to the hospital PC team. 64.5%, 38.9% and 57.5% experienced dyspnoea, pain and confusion, respectively. Dyspnoea was commonly medicated (92%), against 56% for pain and 8% for confusion.

Due to the rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, many health care systems are at risk of exceeding their health care capacities, in particular in terms of SARS-CoV-2 tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and mechanical ventilators. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on health care systems by identifying those who are most likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, be hospitalized, or admitted to the ICU. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop, study, and evaluate clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine learning and based on routinely collected clinical data, which patients are likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or require hospitalization or intensive care. METHODS: Using a systematic approach to model development and optimization, we trained and compared various types of machine learning models, including logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, random forests, and gradient boosting. To evaluate the developed models, we performed a retrospective evaluation on demographic, clinical, and blood analysis data from a cohort of 5644 patients. In addition, we determined which clinical features were predictive to what degree for each of the aforementioned clinical tasks using causal explanations. RESULTS: Our experimental results indicate that our predictive models identified patients that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI 67%-81%) and a specificity of 49% (95% CI 46%-51%), patients who are SARS-CoV-2 positive that require hospitalization with 0.92 area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC; 95% CI 0.81-0.98), and patients who are SARS-CoV-2 positive that require critical care with 0.98 AUC (95% CI 0.95-1.00).

Chemical, physical, and toxicological features of smoking products (vapors as well as mainstream, side stream, and third-hand smoke) have been investigated extensively. Special attention is paid to organic compounds (individually or in combination giving rise to peculiar molecular fingerprints), potentially able to act as “chemical signature” of TS. In this regard, the percent distribution of long-chainnormal, iso, and anteiso alkanes was ascertained as typical of TS. Nevertheless, until now no indexes have been identified as suitable for assessing the global TS contribution to environmental pollution, e.g., the TS percentage in carbonaceous aerosol and in deposited dusts, the only exception consisting in the use of nicotelline as tracer. This paper describes the results of an extensive study aimed at chemically characterizing the nonpolar lipid fraction associated to suspended particulates (PMs) and deposition dusts (DDs) collected at indoor and outdoor locations. Based on the iso, anteiso, and normal C(29)–C(34) alkane profile in the samples as well in tobacco smoke- and no-TS-related emissions (literature data), various parameters describing the distribution of compounds were investigated. Finally, a cumulative variable was identified as the tobacco smoke impact index (TS%) suitable for estimating the TS percentage occurring in the particulate matter. The TS% rates were plotted vs. the exceedance of normal C(31) alkane with respect to the average of C(29) and C(33) homologs, which results higher in TS than in most other emissions, revealing a link in the case of suspended particulates but not of deposited dusts. According to back analysis carried out on all particulate matter sets, it was found that traces of TS affect even remote areas, while inside the smokers’ homes the contributions of TS to PM could account for up to ~61% and ~10%, respectively, in PM and DD. This confirms the need of valuing the health risk posed by TS to humans, by means of tools easy to apply in extensive investigations.

The soil moisture control strategy was designed to regulate wastewater disposal timing according to drain field conditions to prevent hydraulic overloading and corresponding environmental hazard. CW2D/HYDRUS simulation modeling was utilized to explore difficult-to-measure aspects of system performance. While the control system successfully adapted hydraulic loading rate to changing drain field conditions, saturated field conditions during the dormant season presented practical application challenges. The paired field experiment and simulation model demonstrate that soil biofilm growth was stimulated in the vicinity of drip emitters. Although biofilm growth is critical in maintaining adequate COD and [Formula: see text] removal efficiencies, the efficient removal of biodegradable COD itself by soil biofilm limits denitrification of formed [Formula: see text] . Furthermore, stimulated soil biofilm growth can create soil clogging around drip emitters, which was discerned in the field experiment along with salt accumulation, both of which were verified by simulation. Comparable modeling of system performance in sand and clay media demonstrate that the placement of soil moisture sensors within the drain field can have pronounced impacts on system hydraulic performance, depending on the soil permeability.

Case Study of South Korea,,,,arxiv,"Resilience has become an emerging topic in various fields of academic research. In spite of its widespread use, there remains conceptual confusion over what resilience means particularly in multi-disciplinary studies including the field of ICT and Development. With the potential of digital technology, research is needed to critically question what key socio-institutional values related to resilience are being strengthened, for what and for whom through the different conceptualizations of resilience. In this study, we conduct an interpretive case study on South Korea's response to the pandemic and construct a chronological narrative to identify key aspects of digital resilience. We identify agility, diversity, and plurality - enabled by active roles of various stakeholders, including citizens, research communities, and private sector - as keys to digital resilience to the pandemic.

To fulfill this need, we turn to the task of open-domain question-answering, which we can use to efficiently find answers to free-text questions from a large set of documents. In this work, we present such a system for the emergent domain of COVID-19. Despite the small data size available, we are able to successfully train the system to retrieve answers from a large-scale corpus of published COVID-19 scientific papers. Furthermore, we incorporate effective re-ranking and question-answering techniques, such as document diversity and multiple answer spans.

The aim of this study was to construct the key elements of a global multidimensional male involvement framework, based on the latest evidence and input of experts in the field. METHODS: For this purpose, a Delphi study, including an international panel of 26 experts, was carried out. The study consisted of three rounds, with 92% of respondents completing all three surveys. Experts were asked to rate indicators within six categories in terms of validity, feasibility, sensitivity, specificity and context robustness. Furthermore, they were encouraged to clarify their rating with open text responses. Indicators were excluded or adapted according to experts’ feedback before inclusion. A 85% agreement was used as threshold for consensus. RESULTS: A general consensus was reached for a global framework for assessing male involvement in maternal health, consisting of five categories: involvement in communication, involvement in decision-making, practical involvement, physical involvement and emotional involvement. CONCLUSIONS: Using the male involvement framework as a tool to assess the concept of male involvement in maternal health at local, national, and international levels could allow improved assessment and comparison of study findings.

An antibacterial composition comprising TiO2 particles immobilized with a bacterial-specific antibody having affinity to bacteria of interest was prepared via a carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (EDC/NHS) coupling reaction between polyacrylic acid (PAA) coated TiO2 and an antibody. As a model case, an antibody to Escherichia coli was conjugated with the PAA-coated TiO2 (TiO2-AbE). We evaluated the enhancement of the antibacterial effect of TiO2-AbE against target E. coli, compared with its effect on other bacteria that lack affinity for the antibody used. The TiO2-AbE inactivated approximately 90% of the E. coli at 15min, whereas the raw TiO2 inactivated approximately 20% of the E. coli after the same period of time under UV irradiation. The TiO2-AbE did not show an enhanced antibacterial effect against non-target bacteria. We infer that close contact between TiO2 particles and E. coli, as a result of the specificity of the antibody, can enhance the direct transfer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by TiO2 particles to the cellular surface under UV irradiation and result in rapid and efficient inactivation of the targeted bacteria. The strategy presented here will facilitate the combination of other receptors and TiO2 particles for the preparation of highly selective and photocatalytic composites to prevent or remediate contamination by unwanted bacteria in a wide variety of natural and man-made systems.",2014-04-27,"Song, Min Young; Jung, Hyoun Duk; Jurng, Jongsoo; Kim, Byoung Chan",Applied Catalysis B: Environmental,,document_parses/pdf_json/f6d85e0ed087e6a1f72370a839cd19d814c5cc36.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32362724/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2013.11.038; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926337313007388; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0926337313007388,98218755.0,2014,233

Understanding the impact of schools on the number of incident and cumulative COVID-19 cases is critical for decision-making. Objective: To determine the quantitative effect of schools being open relative to community-based non-pharmaceutical interventions on the number of COVID-19 cases. Design: An agent-based transmission model. Setting: A synthetic population of one million individuals based on the characteristics of the population of Ontario, Canada. Participants: Members of the synthetic population clustered into households, neighborhoods or rural districts, cities or a rural region, day care facilities, classrooms (primary, elementary or high school), colleges or universities and workplaces. Exposure: School reopening on September 15, 2020, versus schools remaining closed under different scenarios for non-pharmaceutical interventions. Main Outcome and Measures: Incident and cumulative COVID-19 cases between September 1, 2020 and October 31, 2020. Results: The percentage of infections among students and teachers acquired within schools was less than 5% across modelled scenarios. Incident case numbers on October 31, 2020, were 4,414 (95% credible interval, CrI: 3,491, 5,382) and 4,740 (95% CrI 3,863, 5,691), for schools remaining closed versus reopening, respectively, with no other community-based non-pharmaceutical intervention; 714 (95%, CrI: 568, 908) and 780 (95% CrI 580, 993) for schools remaining closed versus reopening, respectively, with community-based non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented; 777 (95% credible CrI: 621, 993) and 803 (95% CrI 617, 990) for schools remaining closed versus reopening, respectively, applied to the observed case numbers in Ontario in early October 2020. Contrasting the scenarios with implementation of community-based interventions versus not doing so yielded a mean difference of 39,355 cumulative COVID-19 cases by October 31, 2020, while keeping schools closed versus reopening them yielded a mean difference of 2,040 cases. Conclusions and relevance: Our simulations suggest that the majority of COVID-19 infections in schools were due to acquisition in the community rather than transmission within schools and that the effect of school reopening on COVID-19 case numbers is relatively small compared to the effects of community-based non-pharmaceutical interventions.",2020-11-20,"Naimark, D.

It is very significant to explore an optimal clinical trial management model during the outbreak period to provide reference and insight for other clinical trial centers worldwide. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the management strategies used to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on oncology clinical trials. METHODS: We implemented a remote management model to maintain clinical trials conducted at Beijing Cancer Hospital, which realized remote project approval, remote initiation, remote visits, remote administration and remote monitoring to get through two COVID-19 outbreaks in the capital city from February to April and June to July 2020. The effectiveness of measures was evaluated as differences in rates of protocol compliance, participants lost to follow-up, participant withdrawal, disease progression, participant mortality, and detection of monitoring problems. RESULTS: During the late of the first outbreak, modifications were made in trial processing, participant management and quality control, which allowed the hospital to ensure the smooth conduct of 572 trials, with a protocol compliance rate of 85.24% for 3718 participants across both outbreaks. No COVID-19 infections were recorded among participants or trial staff, and no major procedural errors occurred between February and July 2020. These measures led to significantly higher rates of protocol compliance and significantly lower rates of loss to follow-up or withdrawal after the second outbreak than after the first, without affecting rates of disease progression or mortality. The hospital provided trial sponsors with a remote monitoring system in a timely manner, and 3820 trial issues were identified.

However, longitudinal studies on the impact of the pandemic on refugee populations are widely lacking. This study was designed to examine the impact of the current pandemic on the mental health of Rohingya refugees living in Bangladesh. METHOD: This longitudinal study involved a convenience sample of 732 Rohingya people with pre-existing health problems who lived in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. The first recruitment was performed on 5 July 2019 (prepandemic visit) and assessed the health status of refugees using the Refugee Health Screener-15 (RHS-15). The follow-up survey was conducted on 10 November 2020, approximately 15 months later, during the pandemic. A total of 342 Rohingya refugees who completed the initial survey participated in the follow-up survey. A newly developed COVID-19 Impact on Quality of Life (COV19-QoL) scale was used alongside the RHS-15 scale during the second survey. Ethical measures were taken in compliance with the current Declaration of Helsinki. The analysis was performed using SPSS 26. RESULT: A total of 342 Rohingya refugees completed this longitudinal survey. The average age of participants was 32.25 ± 14.01 years (SD), and the predominant age group was ≤ 30 years (n = 207, 60.5%). Most of the participants were female (n = 209, 61.1%). A significant increase in stress was noted from the prepandemic to pandemic periods, as determined by the RHS-15 scale (RHS-15 Part I: 22.96 ± 8.43 vs. 46.72 ± 1.87, p < 0.001; and RHS-15 Part II: 4.43 ± 1.59 vs. 6.91 ± 1.49, p < 0.001). The mean COV19-QoL score of the participants was 4.47 ± 0.15 (out of 5), indicating a perceived negative impact of the pandemic in their lives. In the multiple regression analysis, female sex (β = 0.604, p = 0.017) and COV19-QoL score (β = 2.537, p = 0.003) were significantly associated with higher perceived distress among participants. CONCLUSION: Rohingya refugees experienced a significant deterioration of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Alongside other socioeconomic, environmental, and political factors, the pandemic itself might have been a crucial contributor to this negative trend.

We explored the traditional usage of wild animals by the local inhabitants in Ladakh area of Trans-Himalayan region, India, using questionnaires and interviews. Furthermore, associations between ethnozoological usage and animal species were also evaluated through multivariate ecological community analysis. The highest priority of local inhabitants was for food followed by medicinal usage. We documented therapeutic uses of 48% of the reported species. Among these Alectoris chukar (chukar), Cuon alpinus (Asiatic wild dog), Lepus oiostolus (hares), Marmota himalayana (marmots), Ovis aries vignei (Ladakh urial), Pantholops hodgsonii (Tibetan antelope), Procapra picticaudata (Tibetan gazelle), Pseudois nayaur (blue sheep), Tetraogallus himalayensis (Himalayan snow), Tetraogallus tibetanus (Tibetan snow cock), and Lutra lutra (common otter) were reported for the first time from this region and are being used for medicinal purpose. Our findings could be valuable as reference data for policymakers, researchers, land managers, common public, and the other stakeholders to develop logical and scientific approaches for sustainable use of faunal diversity in biodiversity hotspot regions. ABSTRACT: Zootherapy is accepted all around the globe not only in ancient cultures but different animal derived medicines are also part of the practice in the modern health care systems. The present study assessed the traditional ethnozoological usage of wild animals by local inhabitants in Ladakh region, India, and the reference data for scientific approaches for protection of faunal diversity in trans-Himalayas. The ethnozoological documentation of the animals in Ladakh was carried out through semistructured and close-ended questionnaire surveys and interviews. Multivariate ecological community analysis was used to elucidate the relationship between ethnozoological usage and animal species. Our results showed three animal usage clusters with 32% similarity. Moreover, the similarity in animal usage between digging tools, trophy, handle of tools, decoration, and matting, showed less than 32% of similarity. The highest priority of local people was for food followed by decoration and medicinal usage. The most frequently used animal parts were meat followed by fur and horn. Medicinal uses of 48% of the reported species, i.e., Alectoris chukar (chukar), Cuon alpinus (Asiatic wild dog), Lepus oiostolus (hares), Marmota himalayana (marmots), Ovis aries vignei (Ladakh urial), Pantholops hodgsonii (Tibetan antelope), Procapra picticaudata (Tibetan gazelle), Pseudois nayaur (blue sheep), Tetraogallus himalayensis (Himalayan snow), Tetraogallus tibetanus (Tibetan snow cock), and Lutra lutra (common otter) were reported for the first time from this region. Our study provides innovative information regarding the ethnozoological knowledge in the Ladakh region and reference data for policymakers, researchers, land managers, common public, and the other stakeholders to develop logical and scientific approaches for sustainable use of faunal diversity in hotspot regions like trans-Himalayas and other similar biodiversity-rich sites.",2020-12-07,"Haq, Shiekh Marifatul; Calixto, Eduardo Soares; Yaqoob, Umer; Ahmed, Riyaz; Mahmoud, Ahmed Hossam; Bussmann, Rainer W.; Mohammed, Osama B.; Ahmad, Khalid; Abbasi, Arshad Mehmood",Animals (Basel),,document_parses/pdf_json/3fb9e41b8af0020362bfb6c2c2a41177e5427ad1.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762308/,,2020,445

These implications are evident in Latin America and the Caribbean due to existing challenges the region faces in accessing water and sanitation services. In spite of significant advances, around 65 million people in the LAC region currently lack appropriate access to water and soap to wash their hands—one of the most basic measures to prevent the spread of disease. Furthermore, social and economic vulnerabilities have exacerbated the effects of the pandemic in the region, particularly among those living in poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic thus requires the mobilization of frameworks such as the human rights to water and sanitation, specifically considering the region’s realities. This paper provides a review of some of the challenges currently faced in the region and advances a series of recommendations for enhancing access to water, sanitation and hygiene.

DESIGN Scoping review. STUDY SAMPLE Literature including hearing outcome measurements for the treatment of conductive and/or mixed hearing loss. RESULTS The literature search identified 1434 studies, with 278 subsequently selected for inclusion. A total of 837 hearing outcome measures were reported and grouped into nine domains. The largest domain constituted pure-tone threshold measurements accounting for 65% of the total outcome measures extracted, followed by the domains of speech testing (20%) and questionnaires (9%). Studies of hearing implants more commonly included speech tests or hearing questionnaires compared with studies of middle ear surgery.

Surgical guidelines were published during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and recommended to avoid laparoscopic surgery as much as possible, in fear that the chimney effect of high flow intraperitoneal gas escape during, and after, the procedure would increase the risk of viral transmission. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during surgery by searching for viral RNA in serial samplings of biological liquids. METHODS: This is a single center prospective cross-sectional study. We used a real-time reverse transcriptase (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to perform swab tests for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 in abdominal fluids, during emergency surgery and on the first post-operative day. In the case of thoracic surgery, we performed a swab test of pleural fluids during chest drainage placement as well as on the first post-operative day. RESULTS: A total of 20 samples were obtained: 5 from pleural fluids, 13 from peritoneal fluids and two from biliary fluid. All 20 swabs performed from biological fluids resulted negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. CONCLUSION: To date, there is no scientific evidence of possible contagion by laparoscopic aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2, neither is certain whether the virus is effectively present in biological fluids.

Since no specific therapeutic drugs for treating COVID‐19 have been approved by FDA, recent studies suggest that the known antimalarial quinine and its derivatives (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) inhibit receptor binding of the viral particles and inhibits the strong “cytokine storm”, which is the main cause of death among infected patients. In particular, the natural alkaloid quinine has shown to possess a better safety profile and greater tolerability compared to its derivatives. Dosage optimization of quinine is still necessary as the currently available dosage forms have controversial pharmacokinetics and safety profiles. Therefore, repurposing quinine dosage forms to improve its pharmacokinetics and safety profile may be necessary to support its use against SARS-CoV-2. In this context, biodegradable/biocompatible polymeric nanoparticles may provide a safe site-specific and controlled quinine delivery, reducing the frequency of drug administration and the dose. In this study, a full atomistic molecular dynamics simulation approach has been used to investigate the use of poly-(glycolic acid) and poly-(lactic acid) and their copolymer poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) as potential delivery systems for lipophilic quinine to get insights into the mechanism of quinine encapsulation and release at the atomic/molecular level.",2021-08-04,"Stipa, Pierluigi; Marano, Stefania; Galeazzi, Roberta; Minnelli, Cristina; Laudadio, Emiliano",Eur Polym J,,document_parses/pdf_json/3bcbd8a31355ac07b6a3643eee6140def02822db.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0014305721004195; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2021.110685; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34366437/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014305721004195?v=s5,236898823.0,2021,199

The purpose of this study is to determine whether HomeStyles-2, a nutrition education and childhood obesity prevention program for families with children in middle childhood (ages 6 to 11 years), motivates parents to re-shape their home environments and weight-related lifestyle practices to be more supportive of meeting national nutrition and physical activity recommendations and weight status of their children more so than those in the control condition. METHODS A research-practice partnership with Florida's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education (SNAP-Ed) program was formed to conduct a cluster randomized trial to evaluate the HomeStyles-2 intervention. SNAP-Ed-eligible individuals who are parents/caregivers of children aged 6-11 living in the study catchment area will be invited to enroll in the study and participate in a six-lesson series using the HomeStyles-2 program or an attention control program. The primary outcome measures related to parent weight-related behaviors will be assessed on the individual level. Linear mixed models with a hierarchical design will be used to assess outcomes of interest. DISCUSSION This study has the potential to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new curriculum implemented in a federal nutrition education program. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, adjustments were made to the intervention design to allow for virtual delivery of the intervention through SNAP-Ed. This unanticipated change will offer much-needed research on the effectiveness of virtual nutrition education, which may help to expand SNAP-Ed's reach across the country.

However, little is known about its potential effect on neuropsychiatric injuries induced or accompanied by metabolic dysfunction of glucose and lipids. METHODS: A nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) rat model was induced via a high-fat diet (HFD), and glucolipid parameters and liver function were measured. Behavioral performance was observed via the open field test (OFT) and the Morris water maze (MWM). The plasma levels of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM1) and TREM2 were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The protein expression levels of Synapsin-1 (Syn-1), Synaptatogmin-1 (Syt-1), TREM1 and TREM2 in the hippocampus were detected using western blotting. Morphological changes in the liver and hippocampus were detected by HE and Oil red or silver staining. RESULTS: Compared with the control rats, HFD-induced NAFLD model rats presented significant metabolic dysfunction, hepatocyte steatosis, and impaired learning and memory ability, as indicated by the increased plasma concentrations of total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG), the impaired glucose tolerance, the accumulated fat droplets and balloon-like changes in the liver, and the increased escaping latency but decreased duration in the target quadrant in the Morris water maze. All these changes were reversed in QUE-treated rats. Moreover, apart from improving the morphological injuries in the hippocampus, treatment with QUE could increase the decreased plasma concentration and hippocampal protein expression of TREM1 in NAFLD rats and increase the decreased expression of Syn-1 and Syt-1 in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested the therapeutic potential of QUE against NAFLD-associated impairment of learning and memory, and the mechanism might involve regulating the metabolic dysfunction of glucose and lipids and balancing the protein expression of synaptic plasticity markers and TREM1/2 in the hippocampus.",2021-11-17,"Gao, Xin-Ran; Chen, Zheng; Fang, Ke; Xu, Jing-Xian; Ge, Jin-Fang",Lipids Health Dis,,document_parses/pdf_json/4bffbf718bc51b4f09af6c70f195d8ddfe7e1729.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12944-021-01590-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34789244/,244346021.0,2021,306

However, skepticism about the vaccine efficacy and safety is constantly reported. To our knowledge, there has been no study assessing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance in Lebanon. The primary objective of this survey is to assess the COVID-19 vaccines’ acceptance and its related determinants in the Lebanese population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Lebanon from February 16 through February 25, 2021. Data was collected using an online questionnaire via social media platforms using the snowball technique. The questionnaire consisted of 47 questions related to sociodemographic and medical history, COVID-19 experience, knowledge, practice, and beliefs towards COVID-19 vaccines, including vaccines acceptance. Binary logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with vaccine acceptance. RESULTS: A total of 1209 questionnaires were completed; around 63.4% have reported their acceptance for receiving the COVID-19 vaccine, while only 57% of participants registered themselves on the national platform. The multivariable analysis showed that a higher knowledge scale, living in an urban residential area, having hypertension, not having a food allergy, reporting a higher fear to experience COVID-19 infection, and receiving or wanting to receive influenza vaccine, were positive predictors of COVID-19 vaccines acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the need to improve knowledge about COVID-19 infection and vaccination through education and awareness programs. Specifically residents of rural areas should be targeted to optimize COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among the Lebanese population.

As a result, social media content creation has transformed into a form of gig work for some creators. In order to better design social media platforms to support this labor, we need to understand professional creators' motivations. In this work, we present a qualitative interview study of the motivations of $22$ U.S. OnlyFans creators. OnlyFans is a subscription-based social media platform that is unique in that it is primarily associated with sexual content (although it is not marketed as such) and thus creators are positioned at the intersection of professional content creation and sex work, exposing them to a unique set of potential challenges. Beyond the typical motivations for pursuing other forms of gig work (e.g., flexibility, autonomy) our findings highlight three key factors explaining the rapid growth of OnlyFans despite the potential stigma of sexual content creation: (1) societal visibility and mainstream acceptance of OnlyFans, created through a combination of celebrity hype and the design of the platform itself; (2) platform design: affordances for boundary setting with clients, privacy from the public, and content archives, which together create a labor environment participants viewed as better than other forms of gig work, a natural avenue for sexual expression, and enabling monetization of existing content, audiences, and skills; and (3) the pandemic, which led to both high demand for immediate income while waiting for -- or after running out of -- unemployment benefits, and increased free time, which increased general demand for pornographic content.",2022-05-20,"Hamilton, Vaughn; Soneji, Ananta; McDonald, Allison; Redmiles, Elissa",,,document_parses/pdf_json/8baa76347a986b92151735b93ae77ca38f6b94ef.json,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.10425v1.pdf,248986297.0,2022,261

METHODS: We present a case series of patients from February and March 2020 who were admitted to our trauma center at Rajaee Hospital Trauma Center, in Shiraz, Iran and had positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test or chest CT scan suggestive of COVID-19 and were admitted to the specific ICU for COVID-19. RESULTS: Eight COVID-19 patients (6 male) with mean age of 40 (SD = 16.3) years old, were presented. All patients were cases of trauma injuries, with multiple injuries including chest trauma and lung contusion, admitted to our trauma center for management of their injuries, but they were diagnosed with COVID-19 as well. Two of them had coinfection of influenza type-B and SARS-CoV-2. All patients were treated for COVID-19 and three of them died; the rest were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSION: Since PCR for SARS-CoV-2 is not always sensitive enough to confirm the cause of pneumonia, chest CT manifestations can be helpful, though, they are not always differentiable from lung contusion. Therefore, both the CT scan and the clinical and paraclinical presentation and course of improvement can be beneficial in diagnosing COVID-19 in the trauma setting.",2020-08-17,"Sabetian, Golnar; Feiz, Farnia; Shakibafard, Alireza; Fard, Hossein Abdolrahimzadeh; Sefidbakht, Sepideh; Jafari, Seyed Hamed; Abbasi, HamidReza; Zare, Masoomeh; Roudgari, Amir; Zand, Farid; Masjedi, Mansoor; Paydar, Shahram",Trauma,,document_parses/pdf_json/10e57eb81d44568289fb6014c25015bd3418ec32.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7435208/,,2020,203

To reduce the impacts of infectious disease outbreaks, the development of a risk index for infectious diseases can be effective, by shifting infectious disease control from emergency response to early detection and prevention. In this study, we introduce a methodology to construct and validate an epidemic risk index using only open data, with a specific focus on scalability. The external validation of our risk index makes use of distance sampling to correct for underreporting of infections, which is often a major source of biases, based on geographical accessibility to health facilities. We apply this methodology to assess the risk of dengue in the Philippines. The results show that the computed dengue risk correlates well with standard epidemiological metrics, i.e. dengue incidence (p = 0.002). Here, dengue risk constitutes of the two dimensions susceptibility and exposure. Susceptibility was particularly associated with dengue incidence (p = 0.047) and dengue case fatality rate (CFR) (p = 0.029). Exposure had lower correlations to dengue incidence (p = 0.211) and CFR (p = 0.163). Highest risk indices were seen in the south of the country, mainly among regions with relatively high susceptibility to dengue outbreaks. Our findings reflect that the modelled epidemic risk index is a strong indication of sub-national dengue disease patterns and has therefore proven suitability for disease risk assessments in the absence of timely epidemiological data. The presented methodology enables the construction of a practical, evidence-based tool to support public health and humanitarian decision-making processes with simple, understandable metrics. The index overcomes the main limitations of existing indices in terms of construction and actionability. Author summary Why Was This Study Done? – Epidemics are among the most costly and destructive natural hazards occurring globally; currently, the response to epidemics is still focused on reaction rather than prevention or preparedness. – The development of an epidemic risk index can support identifying high-risk areas and can guide prioritization of preventive action and humanitarian response. – While several frameworks for epidemic risk assessment exist, they suffer from several limitations, which resulted in limited uptake by local health actors - such as governments and humanitarian relief workers - in their decision-making processes What Did the Researchers Do and Find? – In this study, we present a methodology to develop epidemic risk indices, which overcomes the major limitations of previous work: strict data requirements, insufficient geographical granularity, validation against epidemiological data. – We take as a case study dengue in the Philippines and develop an epidemic risk index; we correct dengue incidence for underreporting based on accessibility to healthcare and show that it correlates well with the risk index (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.69, p-value 0.002). What Do These Findings Mean? – Our methodology enables the development of disease-specific epidemic risk indices at a sub-national level, even in countries with limited data availability; these indices can guide local actors in programming prevention and response activities. – Our findings on the case study show that the epidemic risk index is a strong indicator of sub-national dengue disease patterns and is therefore suitable for disease risk assessments in the absence of timely and complete epidemiological data.",2021-02-23,"Hierink, Fleur; Margutti, Jacopo; van den Homberg, Marc; Ray, Nicolas",bioRxiv,,document_parses/pdf_json/54be93e45be5113a4da8b434c22199a471221d4a.json,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.23.432447,232059782.0,2021,527

The aim of the present paper is to provide a scientific overview on the pathogenesis of mucormycosis in COVID-19 beyond the conventional understanding of the disease process, which may not otherwise explain the increased incidence of mucormycosis in SARS-CoV-2.

Apart from the acknowledged role of ketoacidosis, high blood sugar, and iron metabolism in the pathogenesis of mucormycosis, other factors involved in pathophysiology of COVID-19 which might alter or enhance the mucormycosis infection such as (1) the role of ferritin, (2) high serum iron, (3) free radical-induced endothelitis, (4) hepcidin activation, (5) upregulation of glucose receptor protein (GRP78) are discussed in the pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated mucormycosis.

Empathy is a prerequisite cognitive reaction for CF. Nurses with greater empathy levels are more prone to develop an emotional connection with patients. However, it is this kind of close bonds that led nurses to experience a deep sense of grief. Cumulative grief may eventually develop into CF. This study examined the levels of grief, empathy and CF, evaluated the correlation among empathy, grief and CF, and verified the role grief as a mediator of the relationship between empathy and CF. METHODS Participants were 794 Chinese oncology nurses in a cross-sectional study. We measures consisted a demographic questionnaire, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, the Texas Revised Inventory of Grief-Present, and the Professional Quality of Life Scale. RESULTS Oncology nurses showed moderate levels of empathy and grief, moderate to high levels of CF. Perspective taking was negatively related to grief and secondary traumatic stress (STS). Empathic concern was negatively related to burnout. Personal distress was positively related to grief, STS and burnout. Grief was positively related to STS and burnout. Grief played a partial mediating role between empathy and STS. CONCLUSIONS Oncology nurses commonly experience CF.

This has increased the need for graphic tools that allow the concurrent visualization of genomes and feature-associated multi-omics data on single publication-ready plots. RESULTS: We present chromoMap, an R package, developed for the construction of interactive visualizations of chromosomes/chromosomal regions, mapping of any chromosomal feature with known coordinates (i.e., protein coding genes, transposable elements, non-coding RNAs, microsatellites, etc.), and chromosomal regional characteristics (i.e. genomic feature density, gene expression, DNA methylation, chromatin modifications, etc.) of organisms with a genome assembly. ChromoMap can also integrate multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics and epigenomics) in relation to their occurrence across chromosomes. ChromoMap takes tab-delimited files (BED like) or alternatively R objects to specify the genomic co-ordinates of the chromosomes and elements to annotate. Rendered chromosomes are composed of continuous windows of a given range, which, on hover, display detailed information about the elements annotated within that range. By adjusting parameters of a single function, users can generate a variety of plots that can either be saved as static image or as HTML documents. CONCLUSIONS: ChromoMap’s flexibility allows for concurrent visualization of genomic data in each strand of a given chromosome, or of more than one homologous chromosome; allowing the comparison of multi-omic data between genotypes (e.g. species, varieties, etc.) or between homologous chromosomes of phased diploid/polyploid genomes. chromoMap is an extensive tool that can be potentially used in various bioinformatics analysis pipelines for genomic visualization of multi-omics data.

Information on COVID-19 in nondialysis CKD patients is not available yet. CASE REPORTS: Here we present 7 patients with grade 4–5 CKD who developed symptomatic COVID-19; they comprise 2.6% of our 267 advanced CKD patients. The estimated GFR was between 12 and 20 mL/min during the month prior to COVID-19. The 3 major symptoms were fever, cough, and dyspnea, and 5 patients showed bilateral pneumonia. Hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ceftriaxone, and steroids were the most frequently prescribed drugs. Two patients needed noninvasive mechanical ventilation. All patients showed minimal to moderate kidney function deterioration during admission, with an eGFR decline below 5 mL/min in 6 cases. No patient required acute dialysis. Six patients were discharged alive and remained dialysis free athe t the time of reporting, and one 76-year-old patient died. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 affects grade 4–5 CKD patients, but prognosis may be acceptable if prompt supportive measures are applied.

This pandemic is a dire public health threat—particularly for those suffering from hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, or diabetes; without approved treatments, it is likely to persist or recur. To facilitate the rapid discovery of inhibitors with clinical potential, we have applied ligand- and structure-based computational approaches to develop a virtual screening methodology that allows us to predict potential inhibitors. In this work, virtual screening was performed against two natural products databases, Super Natural II and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Additionally, we have used an integrated drug repurposing approach to computationally identify potential inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 in databases of drugs (both approved and withdrawn). Roughly 360,000 compounds were screened using various molecular fingerprints and molecular docking methods; of these, 80 docked compounds were evaluated in detail, and the 12 best hits from four datasets were further inspected via molecular dynamics simulations.

To meet the requirements for contamination-free water, a cost-effective water treatment can substantially improve the developing world’s health, largely for children, and there is predicted to be a huge market for this. Existing water treatment processes consist of various phases that are time-consuming as well as pricey. There is an essential demand for cost-effective point of use methods to purify drinking water to reduce the impact of diseases induced by numerous waterborne pathogens. The development of micro-devices, with different outcomes, can be a helpful solution to various problems. To make this reality, a novel microfluidic device for the purification of water, with multiple hydrodynamic effects, has been shown in this paper. In the proposed novel device, the network of interconnected microfluidic channels was created in such a way that an amalgamation of multiple effects, such as the Fåhræus effect, centrifugal force, the Zweifach–Fung effect and constriction followed by expansion, act together in the microchannel to separate suspended impurities (i.e. bacteria and similar length scale particles present in water in the suspension form) from water. Furthermore, to improve the bacterial separation efficiency of the device, the pure water channel of the microdevice was designed with an encircled triple-sided film valve arrangement at a few points, which aided the modulation of the cross-sectional area of the pure water channel. Consecutively, the reduction of the cross-sectional area of the pure water channel caused a highly effective Zweifach–Fung effect, which aided the better separation of the suspended particles (i.e. bacteria, dust particles etc.). The device was observed to have an average of 99.6% efficiency in the separation of suspended microparticles/microbes with dimensions in the range of 1–10 micrometres. The device performance indicated its potential for the separation of other similar suspended impurities, i.e. small dust particles, bacteria, fungi, viruses and similar particles present in water in the suspension form.",2021-08-25,"Prabhakar, Amit; Jaiswar, Ankur; Mishra, Neha; Kumar, Praveen; Dhwaj, Amar; Nayak, Prashant; Verma, Deepti",RSC advances,,document_parses/pdf_json/990930f7e3a5317cd96980307d9248ea686290bf.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35478548/; https://doi.org/10.1039/d1ra04353f,238931367.0,2021,338

These parasites are transmitted by the bite of an infective female Anopheles species mosquito. The majority of malaria infections in the United States occur among persons who have traveled to regions with ongoing malaria transmission. However, malaria is occasionally acquired by persons who have not traveled out of the country through exposure to infected blood products, congenital transmission, nosocomial exposure, or local mosquitoborne transmission. Malaria surveillance in the United States is conducted to provide information on its occurrence (e.g., temporal, geographic, and demographic), guide prevention and treatment recommendations for travelers and patients, and facilitate rapid transmission control measures if locally acquired cases are identified. PERIOD COVERED: This report summarizes confirmed malaria cases in persons with onset of illness in 2017 and trends in previous years. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Malaria cases diagnosed by blood film microscopy, polymerase chain reaction, or rapid diagnostic tests are reported to local and state health departments through electronic laboratory reports or by health care providers or laboratory staff members. Case investigations are conducted by local and state health departments, and reports are transmitted to CDC through the National Malaria Surveillance System (NMSS), the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), or direct CDC consultations. CDC reference laboratories provide diagnostic assistance and conduct antimalarial drug resistance marker testing on blood samples submitted by health care providers or local or state health departments. This report summarizes data from the integration of all cases from NMSS and NNDSS, CDC reference laboratory reports, and CDC clinical consultations. RESULTS: CDC received reports of 2,161 confirmed malaria cases with onset of symptoms in 2017, including two congenital cases, three cryptic cases, and two cases acquired through blood transfusion. The number of malaria cases diagnosed in the United States has been increasing since the mid-1970s; in 2017, the number of cases reported was the highest in 45 years, surpassing the previous peak of 2,078 confirmed cases reported in 2016. Of the cases in 2017, a total of 1,819 (86.1%) were imported cases that originated from Africa; 1,216 (66.9%) of these came from West Africa. The overall proportion of imported cases originating from West Africa was greater in 2017 (57.6%) than in 2016 (51.6%). Among all cases, P. falciparum accounted for the majority of infections (1,523 [70.5%]), followed by P. vivax (216 [10.0%]), P. ovale (119 [5.5%]), and P. malariae (55 [2.6%]). Infections by two or more species accounted for 22 cases (1.0%). The infecting species was not reported or was undetermined in 226 cases (10.5%). CDC provided diagnostic assistance for 9.5% of confirmed cases and tested 8.0% of specimens with P. falciparum infections for antimalarial resistance markers. Most patients (94.8%) had symptom onset <90 days after returning to the United States from a country with malaria transmission. Of the U.S. civilian patients who reported reason for travel, 73.1% were visiting friends and relatives. The proportion of U.S. residents with malaria who reported taking any chemoprophylaxis in 2017 (28.4%) was similar to that in 2016 (26.4%), and adherence was poor among those who took chemoprophylaxis. Among the 996 U.S. residents with malaria for whom information on chemoprophylaxis use and travel region were known, 93.3% did not adhere to or did not take a CDC-recommended chemoprophylaxis regimen. Among 805 women with malaria, 27 reported being pregnant. Of these, 10 pregnant women were U.S. residents, and none reported taking chemoprophylaxis to prevent malaria. A total of 26 (1.2%) malaria cases occurred among U.S. military personnel in 2017, fewer than in 2016 (41 [2.0%]). Among all reported cases in 2017, a total of 312 (14.4%) were classified as severe malaria illnesses, and seven persons died. In 2017, CDC analyzed 117 P. falciparum-positive and six P. falciparum mixed-species samples for antimalarial resistance markers (although certain loci were untestable in some samples); identification of genetic polymorphisms associated with resistance to pyrimethamine were found in 108 (97.3%), to sulfadoxine in 77 (69.4%), to chloroquine in 38 (33.3%), to mefloquine in three (2.7%), and to atovaquone in three (2.7%); no specimens tested contained a marker for artemisinin resistance. The data completeness of key variables (species, country of acquisition, and resident status) was lower in 2017 (74.4%) than in 2016 (79.4%). INTERPRETATION: The number of reported malaria cases in 2017 continued a decades-long increasing trend, and for the second year in a row the highest number of cases since 1971 have been reported. Despite progress in malaria control in recent years, the disease remains endemic in many areas globally. The importation of malaria reflects the overall increase in global travel to and from these areas. Fifty-six percent of all cases were among persons who had traveled from West Africa, and among U.S. civilians, visiting friends and relatives was the most common reason for travel (73.1%). Frequent international travel combined with the inadequate use of prevention measures by travelers resulted in the highest number of imported malaria cases detected in the United States in 4 decades. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: The best way to prevent malaria is to take chemoprophylaxis medication during travel to a country where malaria is endemic. Adherence to recommended malaria prevention strategies among U.S. travelers would reduce the numbers of imported cases; reasons for nonadherence include prematurely stopping after leaving the area where malaria was endemic, forgetting to take the medication, and experiencing a side effect. Travelers might not understand the risk that malaria poses to them; thus, health care providers should incorporate risk education to motivate travelers to be adherent to chemoprophylaxis. Malaria infections can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated promptly with antimalarial medications appropriate for the patient’s age, medical history, the likely country of malaria acquisition, and previous use of antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Antimalarial use for chemoprophylaxis and treatment should be informed by the most recent guidelines, which are frequently updated. In 2018, two formulations of tafenoquine (i.e., Arakoda and Krintafel) were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the United States. Arakoda was approved for use by adults for chemoprophylaxis; the regimen requires a predeparture loading dose, taking the medication weekly during travel, and a short course posttravel. The Arakoda chemoprophylaxis regimen is shorter than alternative regimens, which could possibly improve adherence. This medication also might prevent relapses. Krintafel was approved for radical cure of P. vivax infections in those aged >16 years and should be co-administered with chloroquine (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/new_info/2020/tafenoquine_2020.html). In April 2019, intravenous artesunate became the first-line medication for treatment of severe malaria in the United States. Artesunate was recently FDA approved but is not yet commercially available. The drug can be obtained from CDC under an investigational new drug protocol. Detailed recommendations for preventing malaria are available to the general public at the CDC website (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/travelers/drugs.html). Health care providers should consult the CDC Guidelines for Treatment of Malaria in the United States and contact the CDC’s Malaria Hotline for case management advice when needed. Malaria treatment recommendations are available online (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment) and from the Malaria Hotline (770-488-7788 or toll-free 855-856-4713). Persons submitting malaria case reports (care providers, laboratories, and state and local public health officials) should provide complete information because incomplete reporting compromises case investigations and efforts to prevent infections and examine trends in malaria cases. Molecular surveillance of antimalarial drug resistance markers (https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/features/ars.html) enables CDC to track, guide treatment, and manage drug resistance in malaria parasites both domestically and internationally. More samples are needed to improve the completeness of antimalarial drug resistance analysis; therefore, CDC requests that blood specimens be submitted for any case of malaria diagnosed in the United States.",2021-03-19,"Mace, Kimberly E.; Lucchi, Naomi W.; Tan, Kathrine R.",MMWR Surveill Summ,,document_parses/pdf_json/bddd12925decce8e37ae2fb18463059a9dd97d19.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8017932/,,2021,1254

In this study, sIFITM3-transgenic (TG) pigs were produced by handmade cloning. Results showed that sIFITM3 was highly overexpressed in many organs of sIFITM3-TG pigs compared to wild-type pigs. After a virulent FMDV strain (O/ES/2001) was intramuscularly inoculated, the sIFITM3-TG pigs showed slightly higher susceptibility to FMDV infection than wild-type pigs. Both groups displayed comparable degrees of clinical symptoms throughout the 14-day observation period. Therefore, the induction of systemic sIFITM3 expression does not protect pigs against FMDV infection.

Prior to these, many Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) had embraced the concept of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and have either commenced or are in the process of implementing various models of health insurance in order to provide financial access to health care to their populations. While evidence of a relationship between experimentation with UHC and increased access to and utilisation of health care in LMICs is common, there is inadequate research evidence on the specific health financing model that is most appropriate for pursuing the objectives of UHC in these settings. Drawing on a synthesis of empirical and theoretical discourses on the feasibility of UHC in LMICs, this paper argues that the journey towards UHC is not a ‘one size fits all’ process, but a long-term policy engagement that requires adaptation to the specific socio-cultural and political economy contexts of implementing countries.

The kidneys are extremely vascular structures and any injury to these vessels during dissection can result in life-threatening bleeding. Hence, it is obvious that beginners most often face difficulty and apprehension at this step of the laparoscopic nephrectomy. We describe a simple technique of laparoscopic nephrectomy which includes the creation of two windows, one at the lower pole and the second at the upper pole, isolation of the hilum, and en bloc stapling of the renal hilar vessels.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence of venous thromboembolic disease (VTD) in COVID‐19 patients and the usefulness of VTD screening based on age‐adjusted D‐dimer and point‐of‐care ultrasound (POCUS). PATIENTS/METHODS: We conducted a single cohort, prospective observational study in 102 consecutive hospitalized patients. RESULTS: A total of 102 POCUS and 39 pulmonary computed tomography angiography (PCTA) were performed diagnosing 27 VTD (26.5%): 17 deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (16.6% positive POCUS) and 18 pulmonary embolism (PE) (46.2% positive PCTA). COVID‐19 patients with VTD were older (P < .030), had higher D‐dimer (P < .001), higher International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis score (P < .001), and higher mortality (P = .025). However, there were no differences in inflammatory laboratory parameters neither in the cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) development. The ROC curve for D‐dimer showed an AUC of 0.91. We have evidenced that patients with D‐dimer between 2000 and 6000 ng/mL could benefit from a screening strategy with POCUS given the high sensitivity and specificity of the test. Furthermore, patients with D‐dimer ≥6000 ng/mL should undergo POCUS and PCTA to rule out DVT and PE, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, 26.5% of the patients presented VTD. Screening strategy based on age‐adjusted D‐dimer and POCUS proved high sensitivity and specificity.

As the coronavirus pandemic continues, many conferences now are being postponed or canceled. Usually, they bring together a complex network of academic and nonacademic professionals to discuss and disseminate new knowledge. The practice of ‘conferencing’ also includes activities that go far beyond the exchange of information. Conferences constitute social spaces where researchers encounter other researchers, establish new contacts, maintain old contacts, hold exploratory talks, and initiate collaborations. Academic conferences therefore can yield a plenitude of scientific and societal impacts. In the past, much progress has been made in measuring the impact of financial investments in science. There is, however, no shared understanding of how to measure the impact of academic conferences. Against the background of the time and money that is spent on both visiting and organizing conferences, it is important to understand the ways in which conferences generate impact. The coronavirus pandemic also shows that it is important to implement digital technologies like tools for virtual conferencing. This article uses qualitative and quantitative data to examine the conference activities of young scholars from German universities and to study how they profit from attending conferences.

Mexico leads worldwide childhood-obesity rankings representing an epidemic problem for public health. To this date, it is still unclear how the gut phageome, the bacteriophage component of the virome, influences childhood obesity and obesity with metabolic syndrome. We characterized the gut phageome of 28 school-age children with healthy normal-weight (NW), obese (O), and obese with metabolic syndrome (OMS) profiles, using metagenomic sequencing of virus-like particles (VLPs) from fecal samples. Viromes derived from VLPs were mainly dominated by Caudovirales, and only Inoviridae family was significantly increased in obesity. The three groups showed a similar number of VLPs, while a significant increase in phage richness and diversity was found in obesity groups compared NW. Few phage contigs dominated the phageome composition in NW, being increased in obesity groups. Interestingly, the majority of the phageome was shared among all individuals, establishing a core and common phageome, which abundances correlated with anthropometric and biochemical traits and bacteria previously associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. We also established a healthy core phageome shared in >80% of NW samples, with a decreased prevalence in the O and OMS groups. Our data support that changes in the gut phageome may contribute to obesity and metabolic syndrome development via bacterial dysbiosis. We consider the phageome characterization provides the basis for novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for managing obesity and preventing metabolic syndrome development in obese children through potential phage manipulation.

Accurate, rapid and simple detection of CDV is critical to improve disease management and prevent outbreaks. In this study, a visible and incubation instrument-free reverse-transcription recombinase polymerase amplification assay combined with lateral flow strip (LFS RT-RPA) was developed to detect CDV using primers and lateral flow (LF) probe specific for the nucleocapsid (N) protein gene. The CDV LFS RT-RPA assay was performed in a closed fist using body heat for 15 min, and the products were visible to the naked eyes on the LFS within 5 min. The assay could detect CDV, and there was no cross-reaction with the other viruses tested. Using the in vitro transcribed CDV RNA as template, the analytical sensitivity was 9.4 × 10(1) copies per reaction, which was the same result as that of a real-time RT-PCR. The assay performance was further evaluated by testing 32 nasal/oropharyngeal swab samples, and CDV RNA positive rate was 62.0% (20/32) by LFS RT-RPA, which was the same result as that of the real-time RT-PCR assay.

Specifically, we position the pandemic as an “unsettled time” (Swidler 1986) and examine how different racialized groups made sense of the economic and health risks posed during this unprecedented period. We find that even when accounting for economic precarity and potential exposure to COVID-19, as well as for various other measures of social status, racialized minorities felt significantly more threatened by COVID-19 than did whites. Religion and political ideology mediated this relationship to some degree, but the racialized differences were substantial. Indeed, we find that even the most liberal whites reported being significantly less concerned about some COVID-19 risks than the most politically conservative of our Latinx and Black respondents. By linking the literature on race and racial stratification with research on risk and culture, we argue that whiteness facilitates a cognitive insulating effect vis-à-vis COVID-19 risks. We discuss the theoretical implications of our findings and conclude by highlighting the enduring importance of racialization, including various manifestations of white privilege, when assessing the social and cultural realities of crises on the ground.",2021-09-10,"Vargas, Nicholas; Mora, G Cristina; Gleeson, Shannon",Soc Probl,,document_parses/pdf_json/0c4c408deeed56776f3e1287ac6ba62ddb0f27bd.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8499969/,,2021,200

TRIAL DESIGN: Phase III, multi-arm (5) and multi-stage (MAMS), randomized, open-label controlled superiority trial. Arm 1: Control arm. Arms 2 to 5: Experimental treatment arms. Planned interim analyses will be conducted at regular intervals. Their results will be reviewed by an Independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Experimental arms may be terminated for futility, efficacy or toxicity before the end of the trial. New experimental arms may be added if new evidence suggests that other treatments should be tested. A feasibility and acceptability substudy as well as an immunological substudy will be conducted alongside the trial. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria are: 65-year-old or more; Positive test for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab; Symptoms onset within 3 days before diagnosis; No hospitalisation criteria; Signed informed consent; Health insurance. Exclusion criteria are: Inability to make an informed decision to participate (e.g.: dementia, guardianship); Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale ≥7; Long QT syndrome; QTc interval > 500 ms; Heart rate <50/min; Kalaemia >5.5 mmol/L or <3.5 mmol/L; Ongoing treatment with piperaquine, halofantrine, dasatinib, nilotinib, hydroxyzine, domperidone, citalopram, escitalopram, potent inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme, repaglinide, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, theophylline, pyrazinamide, warfarin; Known hypersensitivity to any of the trial drugs or to chloroquine and other 4-aminoquinolines, amodiaquine, mefloquine, glafenine, floctafenine, antrafenine, ARB; Hepatic porphyria; Liver failure (Child-Pugh stage ≥B); Stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m²); Dialysis; Hypersentivity to lactose; Lactase deficiency; Abnormalities in galactose metabolism; Malabsorption syndrome; Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency; Symptomatic hyperuricemia; Ileus; Colitis; Enterocolitis; Chronic hepatitis B virus disease. The trial is being conducted in France in the Bordeaux, Corse, Dijon, Nancy, Paris and Toulouse areas as well as in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Participants are recruited either at home, nursing homes, general practices, primary care centres or hospital outpatient consultations. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The four experimental treatments planned in protocol version 1.2 (April 8(th), 2020) are: (1) Hydroxychloroquine 200 mg, 2 tablets BID on day 0, 2 tablets QD from day 1 to 9; (2) Imatinib 400 mg, 1 tablet QD from day 0 to 9; (3) Favipiravir 200 mg, 12 tablets BID on day 0, 6 tablets BID from day 1 to 9; (4) Telmisartan 20 mg, 1 tablet QD from day 0 to 9. The comparator is a complex of vitamins and trace elements (AZINC Forme et Vitalité®), 1 capsule BID for 10 days, for which there is no reason to believe that they are active on the virus. In protocol version 1.2 (April 8th, 2020): People in the control arm will receive a combination of vitamins and trace elements; people in the experimental arms will receive hydroxychloroquine, or favipiravir, or imatinib, or telmisartan. MAIN OUTCOME: The primary outcome is the proportion of participants with an incidence of hospitalisation and/or death between inclusion and day 14 in each arm. RANDOMISATION: Participants are randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to each arm using a web-based randomisation tool. Participants not treated with an ARB or ACEI prior to enrolment are randomized to receive the comparator or one of the four experimental drugs. Participants already treated with an ARB or ACEI are randomized to receive the comparator or one of the experimental drugs except telmisartan (i.e.: hydroxychloroquine, imatinib, or favipiravir). Randomisation is stratified on ACEI or ARBs treatment at inclusion and on the type of residence (personal home vs. nursing home). BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-label trial. Participants, caregivers, investigators and statisticians are not blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 1057 participants will be enrolled if all arms are maintained until the final analysis and no additional arm is added. Three successive futility interim analyses are planned, when the number of participants reaches 30, 60 and 102 in the control arm. Two efficacy analyses (interim n°3 and final) will be performed successively. TRIAL STATUS: This describes the Version 1.2 (April 8(th), 2020) of the COVERAGE protocol that was approved by the French regulatory authority and ethics committee. The trial was opened for enrolment on April 15(th), 2020 in the Nouvelle Aquitaine region (South-West France). Given the current decline of the COVID-19 pandemic in France and its unforeseeable dynamic in the coming months, new trial sites in 5 other French regions and in Luxembourg are currently being opened. A revised version of the protocol was submitted to the regulatory authority and ethics committee on June 15(th), 2020. It contains the following amendments: (i) Inclusion criteria: age ≥65 replaced by age ≥60; time since first symptoms <3 days replaced by time since first symptoms <5 days; (ii) Withdrawal of the hydroxychloroquine arm (due to external data); (iii) increase in the number of trial sites. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered on Clinical Trials.gov on April 22(nd), 2020 (Identifier: NCT04356495): and on EudraCT on April 10(th), 2020 (Identifier: 2020-001435-27).

DESIGN: A cross-sectional study performed using an anonymous online questionnaire distributed through social media, email and the Department of Social Welfare. SETTING: Malaysian families were invited to answer the questionnaires. The sampling was performed between 12 May 2020 and 9 June 2020. INTERVENTION: The psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and Children’s Revised Impact of Event Scale (CRIES). The mental health status was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) 21. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: (1) Psychological impact on Malaysian families. (2) Prevalence of mental health status of Malaysian families during COVID-19 pandemic. RESULT: A total of 409 Malaysian families have responded (409 parents and 348 children), 154 respondents (38%) reported high psychological impact (score 14) for psychological construct and 189 respondents (46%) reported high psychological impact (score 6) for behavioural construct. A significantly higher proportion of respondents with not permanent employment status of the family lead reported high psychological impact.

Patient-reported outcome questionnaires are increasingly being considered as the keystones of pelvic floor disorder assessment. An innovative English language multidisciplinary electronic Personal Assessment Questionnaire (ePAQ-PF) was psychometrically validated in 2006. A certified Italian version (I.ePAQ-PF) has been recently made available by the Italian Society of Urodynamics. In this study, we aimed to test the psychometric properties to validate the urinary dimension of the I.ePAQ-PF. METHODS Women complaining of lower urinary tract symptoms were enrolled. After providing informed consent, women filled in the I.ePAQ-PF via a dedicated touch-screen display (T0), together with concurrent questionnaires: International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short form, Urgency Severity Scale, Urogenital Distress Inventory, and Patient Global Impression of Improvement. Cronbach's α and Spearman's correlation coefficients were adopted (validity). A test-retest was performed in 47 cases (reliability), and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was analyzed. I.ePAQ-PF was also administered after treatment (T1) and compared with baseline data via a Wilcoxon's test and Cohen's effect-size tests (responsiveness). RESULTS Ninety-three women were included. Internal consistency was confirmed (Cronbach's α >.7). A Spearman's correlation test showed a good correlation (>0.6) between I.ePAQ-PF and conceptually similar questionnaires. I.ePAQ-PF seems to be highly reproducible in all domains (ICC >0.86). The questionnaire scored significantly differently (Wilcoxon test P < .003) in all domains after the treatment. Responsiveness was further confirmed by Cohen's effect size of more than 30%.

Background: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China spreads rapidly since December, 2019. Most patients show mild symptoms, but some of them develop into severe disease. There is currently no specific medication. The purpose of this study is to to explore changes of markers in peripheral blood of severe COVID-19 patients, which may be of value in disease monitoring. Methods Clinical data of patients with nonsevere and severe type COVID-19 diagnosed by laboratory test in our institution were collected. The relationship between peripheral blood cells and cytokines, clinical manifestation and outcome was analyzed. Results A total of 69 severe type COVID-19 patients were included. On admission, the median age of severe cases was 56-year old, with 52.17% female patient. The most common symptoms were fever (79.72%), cough (63.77%), shortness of breath (57.97%) and fatigue (50.72%). Diarrhea is less common. The most common comorbidity is hypertension. Upon admission, the proportion of bilateral pulmonary involvement and interstitial abnormalities evidenced by chest computed tomography (CT) imaging in severe cases was 60.87% and 27.54%, respectively. Compared with patients with nonsevere disease, those with severe disease showed obvious lymphocytopenia. Elevated level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin and D-dimer was found in most cases. Two patients (2.9%) needed transfer to the intensive care unit. Baseline immunological parameters and most of the inflammatory parameters were basically within the normal range. However, baseline interleukin-6 (IL-6) was significantly increased in severe type, which was closely related to the maximal body temperature during hospitalization and to CT findings. Baseline IL-6 was also significantly related to the increase of baseline level of CRP, LDH, ferritin and D-dimer. The increase of baseline IL-6 level suggests that it may positively correlate with the severity of COVID-19. Among the 30 severe type patients whose IL-6 was assessed before and after treatment, significant decrease in IL-6 and improved CT assessment was found in 25 patients after treatment. Whereas the IL-6 level was further increased in 3 cases, which was closely related to disease progression. It is suggested that IL-6 may be used as a marker for disease monitoring in severe COVID-19 patients. Conclusions On admission, the baseline level of IL-6, CRP, LDH and ferritin was closely related to the severity of COVID-19, and the elevated IL-6 was significantly related to the clinical manifestation of severe type patients. The decrease of IL-6 was closely related to treatment effectiveness, while the increase of IL-6 indicated disease exacerbation. Collectively, the dynamic change of IL-6 level can be used as a marker for disease monitoring in patients with severe COVID-19.",2020-03-06,"Liu, Tao; Zhang, Jieying; Yang, Yuhui; Ma, Hong; Li, Zhengyu; Zhang, Jiaoyue; Cheng, Ji; Zhang, Xiaoyun; Zhao, Yanxia; Xia, Zihan; Zhang, Liling; Wu, Gang; Yi, Jianhua",,,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029769,215718659.0,2020,429

Vaccination programmes are being rolled out in high income countries, but the pandemic continues to progress in many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) despite implementation of strict hygiene measures. We aim to present a comprehensive research protocol that will generate epidemiological, sociological and anthropological data about the COVID-19 epidemic in Burkina Faso, a landlocked country in West Africa with scarce resources. METHODS: We will perform a multidisciplinary research using mixed methods in the two main cities in Burkina Faso (Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso). Data will be collected in the general population and in COVID-19 patients, caregivers and health care professionals in reference care centers: (i) to determine cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Burkinabe population using blood samples collected from randomly selected households according to the WHO-recommended protocol; (ii) develop a score to predict severe complications of COVID-19 in persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 using retrospective and prospective data; (iii) perform semi-structured interviews and direct observation on site, to describe and analyze the healthcare pathways and experiences of patients with COVID-19 attending reference care centers, and to identify the perceptions, acceptability and application of preventive strategies among the population. DISCUSSION: This study will generate comprehensive data that will contribute to improving COVID-19 response strategies in Burkina Faso. The lessons learned from the management of this epidemic may serve as examples to the country authorities to better design preventive strategies in the case of future epidemics or pandemics.

Azathioprine (AZA) is a purine analog that is commonly used for maintaining GPA remission after induction therapy with cyclophosphamide. While the dose-dependent side effects of AZA are common and well known, hypersensitivity reactions such as pulmonary toxicity are rare. Here, we describe a case involving a 38-year-old man with GPA-associated pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis who developed subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) during AZA maintenance therapy. Five months after the initiation of AZA administration (100 mg/day), the patient was admitted with a 7-day history of cough, dyspnea, and fever. High-resolution computed tomography of the chest showed ill-defined centrilobular nodules and diffuse ground-glass opacities in both lung fields. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for infectious etiologies. A transbronchial lung biopsy specimen revealed poorly formed non-necrotizing granulomas. A chest radiograph obtained at 2 weeks after discontinuation of AZA showed normal findings.

The compartments were the susceptible (S), the asymptomatic infective (A), the presymptomatic infective (L), the symptomatic infective (I), the recovered (R), and the deceased (D). The A, L and I classes were infective states. To construct the model, several parameters were set as fixed using existing evidence and the rest of the parameters were estimated by fitting the model to a smoothed curve of the cumulative confirmed cases in Wuhan from 24 January 2020 to 6 March 2020. Input data about the cost-effectiveness analysis were retrieved from the literature. RESULTS: Conducting RT-PCR tests three times for diagnosing and discharging people with COVID-19 reduced the estimated total number of symptomatic cases to 45‌ 013 from 51 144 in the two-test strategy over 43 days. The former strategy also led to 850.1 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of health gain and a net healthcare expenditure saving of CN¥49.1 million. About 100.7 QALYs of the health gain were attributable to quality-adjusted life day difference between the strategies during the analytic period and 749.4 QALYs were attributable to years of life saved. CONCLUSIONS: More accurate strategies and methods of testing for the control of COVID-19 may reduce both the number of infections and the total medical costs. Increasing the number of tests should be considered in regions with relatively severe epidemics when existing tests have moderate sensitivity.",2020-07-19,"Jiang, Yawen; Cai, Dan; Chen, Daqin; Jiang, Shan",BMJ Glob Health,,document_parses/pdf_json/ab2c0ec390c398dc5b6b7840139d8538b7cc4c42.json; document_parses/pdf_json/98b7b5b9725c2aa07d120ddaca0f92be121f72a7.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32694221/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002690,220698640.0,2020,281

We sought to explore whether problematic internet use in specific countries was related to emotional well-being and importantly whether this is predicted by psychological distress. There is a growing number of studies showing that problematic internet use is increasingly prevalent in countries with emerging economies, however we have yet to find out to what extent other factors are influencing this behaviour in adolescents and young people. This study invited young people from countries such India, Mexico, Philippines and Turkey to complete a set of self-reports on their daily internet habits, social media use, alongside questions on psychological distress, self-esteem, loneliness and escapism. A total of 1182 young people aged between 16 and 25 years old completed these questionnaires online. The results showed that there were significant difference in problematic internet use scores among adolescents in the Philippines and Turkey. More specifically, social media use was significantly higher amongst young people from the Philippines whereas gaming addiction was significantly high in the Turkish sample. These findings also revealed that psychological distress, loneliness, and low self-esteem consistently predicted problematic internet use.

We further sought to identify journal characteristics that might influence TTA and TTOP. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We searched the publication history of 5 leading international radiation oncology journals. For all research articles accepted from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019, we tabulated the date of article receipt, the date of acceptance, and the date of online publication when available. The TTA was calculated as the number of elapsed days from article receipt to acceptance, and the TTOP was calculated as the number of elapsed days from article acceptance to online publication. Using the Mann-Kendall test, we assessed for monotonic trends over time and used the post hoc Theil-Sen method to estimate rates of change. We created a multiple regression model to identify journal characteristics associated with TTA and TTOP. RESULTS: In total, 10,132 articles were included. Both the TTA and the TTOP decreased significantly from 2010 to 2019 (P = .005 and P < .001, respectively), with an estimated decrease of 1.5 days per year for the TTA and 7.0 days per year for the TTOP. Multiple regression modeling revealed that a higher journal impact factor was independently associated with an increased TTA (P < .001) and a decreased TTOP (P < .001). A higher number of accepted journal articles per year was associated with a decreased TTA (P < .001) and an increased TTOP (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Radiation oncology research has been accepted and published online at increasingly faster rates during the past decade. The TTA may be longer in higher-impact, more selective journals, possibly suggesting a need for comprehensive peer review and complex editorial decisions. However, these articles are also published online faster after article acceptance.

To date, no medicine is available for the responsible virus SARS‐CoV‐2. 3CLpro, that is, 3‐chymotrypsin‐like protease, the main protease (M(pro)), has an important role in cleaving pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins. This M(pro) serves as an important target in drug designing against COVID‐19. Herein, the study includes the investigation, screening, and identification of potent leads from (Withania sps.), against SARS‐CoV‐2, using virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Seventy‐three natural compounds from this important medicinal plant were screened. The Binding affinity was used to identify the most probable target to inhibit the M(pro), compounds 27‐hydroxywithanolide F (W32, −11.5 kcal/mol), withanolide A (W56, −11.4 kcal/mol), and withacoagulin H (W30, −11.1 kcal/mol) showed highest binding energy. Lipinski's rule, followed by drug‐likability and likeness screening, resulted in 36 molecules. Further, MD simulation of 50 ns predicted withacoagulin H possessing strong binding affinity and hydrogen‐bonding interactions with the active site. The binding free energy calculation showed the most negative energy of withacoagulin H (−63.463 KJ/mol) compared to other selected compounds. The study also compared the bonding energy of already reported repurposed and newly synthesized drugs. Further, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion predictions were made to found a good balance of potency.

While many protocols have been optimized for optimal cell yield, they have often overlooked the effects that dissociation can have on ex vivo gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that use of enzymatic dissociation on brain tissue induces an aberrant ex vivo gene expression signature, most prominently in microglia, which is prevalent in published literature and can substantially confound downstream analyses. To address this issue, we present a rigorously validated protocol that preserves both in vivo transcriptional profiles and cell-type diversity and yield across tissue types and species. We also identify a similar signature in postmortem human brain single-nucleus RNA-sequencing datasets, and show that this signature is induced in freshly isolated human tissue by exposure to elevated temperatures ex vivo.

The trimeric spike glycoproteins are displayed at the surface of self-assembling Virus-Like-Particles that mimic the shape and the size of the virus. The candidate vaccine (CoVLP) administered alone or with AS03 or CpG1018 adjuvants was evaluated in a Phase 1 trial in healthy adults. (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT04450004) Methods: The study was a randomized, partially-blinded, prime-boost 21 days apart, dose-escalation Phase 1 study intended to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of CoVLP at three dose levels (3.75 microgram, 7.5 microgram, and 15 microgram) unadjuvanted or adjuvanted with either CpG 1018 or AS03 in 180 SARS-CoV-2 seronegative healthy adults 18 to 55 years of age. Enrollment was staggered for dose-escalation. At each dose level, the vaccine was initially administered to a small number of subjects. Vaccination of the remaining subjects at the same dose level and the next higher vaccine dose level was administered with approval of an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC). The same procedure was followed for the second vaccine administration. Monitoring of safety signals was performed throughout the study with pre-determined pausing/stopping rules if there was clear evidence of harmful effects such as severe adverse events (AEs) related to the treatment. The primary endpoints were the safety and tolerability of the vaccine after each dose and the immunogenicity as assessed by neutralizing antibody responses assessed using a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudovirion assay and interferon-gamma and interleukin-4 (IL-4) ELISpot assays at Days 0, 21 and 42. Secondary endpoints were anti-spike antibody responses by ELISA and neutralizing antibodies measured by live virus plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) assay at Days 0, 21 and 42 and immunogenicity with additional safety and immunogenicity endpoints planned for 6-months following the last vaccination. The anti-spike and neutralizing antibody responses were compared with 23 convalescent serum samples from symptomatic Covid-19 patients. We performed a primary analysis at day 42. Results: A total of 180 subjects (102 females: 78 males: average 34.3 years) were recruited to the study and interim safety and immunogenicity data up to day 42 after the first dose are reported here. There was no obvious CoVLP dose effect in safety outcomes for any of the formulations tested and all formulations were generally well-tolerated. Most solicited local and systemic AEs were mild-moderate and transient. Reactogenicity was increased in all adjuvanted formulations and was generally highest in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. Local and systemic adverse events were reported with similar frequency after the first and second doses in subjects who received either CoVLP alone or CoVLP+CpG1018 but increased in both frequency and severity after the second dose in the CoVLP+AS03 groups. CoVLP alone only elicited a weak total anti-spike IgG response at the highest dose level and little-to-no neutralization antibody response, even after the second dose. Cellular responses in the CoVLP alone groups (IFN-gamma and IL-4) were detectable after the second dose but were still only marginally above background levels. The addition of either adjuvant substantially increased both antibody and cellular responses at most CoVLP dose levels and changes were most pronounced after the second dose. However, a substantial neutralizing antibody response after the first dose was only seen in all CoVLP+AS03 groups. After the second dose, both total anti-spike IgG and neutralizing antibody titers in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. The antibody titers achieved were either similar to (CoVLP+CpG1018) or at least 10-times higher (CoVLP+AS03) than those seen in convalescent plasma. Administration of CoVLP with either adjuvant also significantly increased the cellular responses. After 2 doses, both IFN-gamma and IL-4 responses were significantly increased in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. In the CoVLP+AS03 groups, significant increases in the cellular responses were observed after the first dose while IFN-gamma and IL-4 increased further in both magnitude and number of subjects responding after the second dose. Again, the cellular responses in the CoVLP+AS03 groups were higher than those seen in the CoVLP+CpG1018 groups. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that CoVLP administered with either CpG1018 or AS03 has a safety profile similar to other candidate vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. When administered with either AS03 or CpG1018, several of the CoVLP dose levels elicited strong humoral and T cell responses after the second dose. When administered with AS03, even the 3.75 microgram CoVLP dose elicited neutralizing antibody titers that were ~10-times higher than those observed in individuals recovering from Covid-19 as well as consistent and balanced IFN-gamma and IL-4 responses. Although many CoVLP formulations were immunogenic, in the absence of established correlates of protection and given the advantages of dose-sparing in the context of the on-going pandemic, these findings suggest that CoVLP (3.75 microgram)+AS03 has a good benefit/risk ratio and support the transition of this formulation to studies in expanded populations and to efficacy evaluations",2020-11-06,"Ward, B.

However, because viral proteins evolve very fast, commonly used sequence similarity detection methods such as BLAST may overlook homologs. We analyzed a data set of proteins from RNA viruses characterized as “genus specific” by BLAST. More powerful methods developed recently, such as HHblits or HHpred (available through web-based, user-friendly interfaces), could detect distant homologs of a quarter of these proteins, suggesting that these methods should be used to annotate viral genomes. In-depth manual analyses of a subset of the remaining sequences, guided by contextual information such as taxonomy, gene order, or domain cooccurrence, identified distant homologs of another third. Thus, a combination of powerful automated methods and manual analyses can uncover distant homologs of many proteins thought to be orphans. We expect these methodological results to be also applicable to cellular organisms, since they generally evolve much more slowly than RNA viruses. As an application, we reanalyzed the genome of a bee pathogen, Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV). We could identify homologs of most of its proteins thought to be orphans; in each case, identifying homologs provided functional clues. We discovered that CBPV encodes a domain homologous to the Alphavirus methyltransferase-guanylyltransferase; a putative membrane protein, SP24, with homologs in unrelated insect viruses and insect-transmitted plant viruses having different morphologies (cileviruses, higreviruses, blunerviruses, negeviruses); and a putative virion glycoprotein, ORF2, also found in negeviruses.

This has hampered the ability to ascertain true infection numbers, evaluate the effectiveness of surveillance strategies, determine transmission dynamics, and estimate reproductive numbers. Leveraging both viral genomic and time series case data offers methods to estimate these parameters. Using a Bayesian inference framework to fit a branching process model to viral phylogeny and time series case data, we estimated time-varying reproductive numbers and their variance, the total numbers of infected individuals, the probability of case detection over time, and the estimated time to detection of an outbreak for 12 locations in Europe, China, and the United States. The median percentage of undetected infections ranged from 13% in New York to 92% in Shanghai, China, with the length of local transmission prior to two cases being detected ranging from 11 days (95% CI: 4-21) in California to 37 days (9-100) in Minnesota. The probability of detection was as low as 1% at the start of local epidemics, increasing as the number of reported cases increased exponentially. The precision of estimates increased with the number of full-length viral genomes in a location. The viral phylogeny was informative of the variance in the reproductive number with the 32% most infectious individuals contributing 80% of total transmission events. This is the first study that incorporates both the viral genomes and time series case data in the estimation of undetected COVID-19 infections. Our findings suggest the presence of undetected infections broadly and that superspreading events are contributing less to observed dynamics than during the SARS epidemic in 2003.

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which enters human target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used a number of bioinformatics tools to computationally characterize ACE2 by determining its cell-specific expression in trachea, lung, and small intestine, derive its putative functions, and predict transcriptional regulation. The small intestine expressed higher levels of ACE2 mRNA than any other organ. By immunohistochemistry, duodenum, kidney and testis showed strong signals, whereas the signal was weak in the respiratory tract. Single cell RNA-Seq data from trachea indicated positive signals along the respiratory tract in key protective cell types including club, goblet, proliferating, and ciliary epithelial cells; while in lung the ratio of ACE2-expressing cells was low in all cell types (<2.6%), but was highest in vascular endothelial and goblet cells. Gene ontology analysis suggested that, besides its classical role in the renin-angiotensin system, ACE2 may be functionally associated with angiogenesis/blood vessel morphogenesis. Using a novel tool for the prediction of transcription factor binding sites we identified several putative binding sites within two tissue-specific promoters of the ACE2 gene as well as a new putative short form of ACE2. These include several interferon-stimulated response elements sites for STAT1, IRF8, and IRF9.

However, updated estimates of their relative effectiveness have been absent for Europe's second wave, largely due to a lack of collated data that considers the increased subnational variation and diversity of NPIs. We collect the largest dataset of NPI implementation dates in Europe, spanning 114 subnational areas in 7 countries, with a systematic categorisation of interventions tailored to the second wave. Using a hierarchical Bayesian transmission model, we estimate the effectiveness of 17 NPIs from local case and death data. We manually validate the data, address limitations in modelling from previous studies, and extensively test the robustness of our estimates. The combined effect of all NPIs was smaller relative to estimates from the first half of 2020, indicating the strong influence of safety measures and individual protective behaviours--such as distancing--that persisted after the first wave. Closing specific businesses was highly effective. Gathering restrictions were highly effective but only for the strictest limits. We find smaller effects for closing educational institutions compared to the first wave, suggesting that safer operation of schools was possible with a set of stringent safety measures including testing and tracing, preventing mixing, and smaller classes.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective study with patients under follow-up in rheumatology departments from seven hospitals in Spain. We matched updated databases of rheumatology patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-positive PCR tests performed in the hospital to the same reference populations. Rates of PCR+ confirmed COVID-19 were compared among groups. RESULTS: Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases had 1.32-fold higher prevalence of hospital PCR+ COVID-19 than the reference population (0.76% vs 0.58%). Patients with systemic autoimmune or immune-mediated disease (AI/IMID) showed a significant increase, whereas patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) or systemic lupus erythematosus did not. COVID-19 cases in some but not all diagnostic groups had older ages than cases in the reference population. Patients with IA on targeted-synthetic or biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), but not those on conventional-synthetic DMARDs, had a greater prevalence despite a similar age distribution. CONCLUSION: Patients with AI/IMID show a variable risk of hospital-diagnosed COVID-19. Interplay of ageing, therapies and disease-specific factors seem to contribute.

By combining near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring of regional tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) with an ischemic provocation test, the vascular occlusion test (VOT), local tissue oxygen consumption and vascular reactivity at the microcirculatory level can be assessed. This systematic review aims to give an overview of the clinical information that VOT-derived NIRS values can provide in the perioperative period. After performing a systematic literature search, we included 29 articles. It was not possible to perform a meta-analysis because of the lack of comparable data and the observational nature of the majority of the included articles. We have clustered the found articles in two groups: non-cardiac surgery and cardiac surgery. We found that VOT-derived NIRS values show a wide variability and are influenced by the effects of anesthetics, cardiovascular drugs, fluids, and by the type of surgery. Additionally, deviations in VOT-derived NIRS values are also associated with adverse patients' outcomes, such as postoperative complications, prolonged mechanical ventilation and prolonged hospital length of stay. However, given the variability in VOT-derived NIRS values, clinical applicability remains elusive. Future clinical interventional trials might provide additional insight into the potential of VOT associated with NIRS to optimize perioperative care by targeting specific interventions to optimize the function of the microvasculature.",2022-01-04,"Niezen, C K; Massari, D; Vos, J J; Scheeren, T W L",Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10877-021-00779-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34982349/,245654591.0,2022,228

The ‘anthropause’, a period of unusually reduced human activity and mobility due to COVID‐19 restrictions, has serendipitously opened up unique opportunities for research on how human activities impact the environment. 2. In the field of health, COVID‐19 research has led to concerns about the quality of research papers and the underlying research and publication processes due to accelerated peer review and publication schedules, increases in pre‐prints and retractions. 3. In the field of environmental science, framing the pandemic and associated global lockdowns as an unplanned global human confinement experiment with urgency should raise the same concerns about the rigorousness and integrity of the scientific process. Furthermore, the recognition of an ‘infodemic’, an unprecedented explosion of research, risks research waste and duplication of effort, although how information is used is as important as the quality of evidence. This highlights the need for an evidence base that is easy to find and use – that is discoverable, curated, synthesizable, synthesized. 4. We put forward a list of 10 key principles to support the establishment of a reproducible, replicable, robust, rigorous, timely and synthesizable COVID‐19 environmental evidence base that avoids research waste and is resilient to the pressures to publish urgently.

Methods: Using a probabilistic model, we analyze the false-negative rate (i.e., the probability of a negative result for an infected individual) of Dorfman pooling. Our model is conservative in that it ignores sample dilution effects, which can only worsen pooling performance. Results: We show that one can expect a 60-80% increase in false-negative rates under Dorfman pooling, for reasonable parameter values. On average, when separate testing misses, e.g., ten infected individuals - Dorfman pooling misses more than sixteen.

An important property of preference relations is transitivity. Many types of transitivity have been proposed in the literature, such as max–min and max–max transitivity, restricted max–min and max–max transitivity, additive and multiplicative transitivity, or Łukasiewicz transitivity. This paper focuses on weak transitivity. Weak transitivity has been defined for additive preference relations. We extend this definition to multiplicative preference relations and further introduce a generalized version called generalized weak transitivity. We show that for reciprocal additive and multiplicative preference relations weak transitivity is equivalent to generalized weak transitivity, and we also illustrate generalized weak transitivity for preference relations that are neither additive nor multiplicative.

We investigated the effect of intubation in trauma patients with a GCS 6–8, with the hypothesis that intubation would increase mortality and length of stay. METHODS: We studied adult patients with GCS 6–8 from the 2016 National Trauma Data Bank. Intubated and non-intubated patients were compared using inverse probability weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) to control for injury severity and patient characteristics. Outcomes were mortality, intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS), and total LOS. Stratified analysis was performed to investigate the effect in patients with and without head injuries. RESULTS: Among 6676 patients with a GCS between 6 and 84,078 were intubated within 1 h of arrival to the emergency department. The overall mortality rate was 15.1%. IPWRA revealed an increase in mortality associated with intubation (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03, 1.06). The results were similar in patients with head injuries (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02, 1.06) and without (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03, 1.10). Among the 5,742 patients admitted to the ICU, intubation was associated with a 14% increase in ICU LOS (95% CI 8–20%; 5.5 vs. 4.8 days; p < 0.001). The overall length of stay was 27% longer (95% CI 19.8–34.3%) among intubated patients (mean 7.7 vs 6.0 days; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Among patients with GCS of 6 to 8, intubation on arrival was associated with an increase in mortality and with longer ICU and overall length of stay.

They are at increased risk of hospitalization and mortality. We outline how remote-only management strategies, which leverage transmitted health-related data, can be used to optimize care for HF patients with a CIED during the COVID-19 pandemic. CASE SUMMARY: An 82-year-old man with HF, stable on medical therapy, underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy implantation in 2016. Modern CIEDs facilitate remote monitoring by providing real-time physiological data (thoracic impedance, heart rate and rhythm, etc.). The ‘Triage Heart Failure Risk Score’ (Triage-HFRS), available on Medtronic CIEDs, integrates several monitored physiological parameters into a risk prediction model classifying patients as low, medium, or high risk of HF events within 30 days. In November 2019, the patient was enrolled in an innovative clinical pathway (Triage-HF Plus) whereby any ‘high’ Triage-HF risk status transmission prompts a phone call-based virtual consultation. A high-risk alert was received via remote transmission on 11 March, triggering a phone call assessment. Upon reporting increasing breathlessness, diuretics were initiated. The prescription was remotely issued and delivered to the patient’s home. This approach circumvented the need for all face-to-face reviews, delivering care in an entirely remote manner. DISCUSSION: The challenges posed by COVID-19 have prompted us to think differently about how we deliver care for patients, both now and following the pandemic. Contemporary CIEDs facilitate the ability to remotely monitor HF patients by providing rich physiological data that can help identify individuals at elevated risk of decompensation using automated device-generated alerts.",2020-09-08,"Ahmed, Fozia Zahir; Crosbie, Carol; Kahn, Matthew; Motwani, Manish",Eur Heart J Case Rep,,document_parses/pdf_json/ca8231d20bc755354d28004387cd56afc5e078f0.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33089059/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa249,221820127.0,2020,252

DESIGN Retrospective longitudinal epigenetic profiling study from 13 people with HIV (PWH) on virologically suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) that participated in a latency-reversal (HDAC inhibitor) clinical trial (NCT01680094) and a subsequent optional ATI to monitor for viral recrudescence after ART cessation. METHODS Genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) in purified CD4+ T cells was measured at single-nucleotide resolution using the Infinium MethylationEPIC array. HIV-1 DNA and RNA measures were previously assessed by PCR-based methods and the association of DNAm levels at regulatory sites of the human genome were examined with reservoir size, responsiveness to latency reversal, and time to viral rebound following ATI. RESULTS A distinct set of 15 candidate DNAm sites in purified CD4+ T cells at baseline pre-LRA and pre-ATI significantly correlated with time to viral rebound. Eight of these DNAm sites occurred in genes linked to HIV-1 replication dynamics including (SEPSECS, cg19113954), (MALT1, cg15968021), (CPT1C, cg14318858), (CRTAM, cg10977115), (B4GALNT4, cg04663285), (IL10, cg16284789), (TFPI2, cg19645693), and (LIFR, cg26437306); with the remaining sites at intergenic regions containing regulatory elements. Moreover, baseline DNAm states related to total HIV-1 DNA levels and the fold change in unspliced cell-associated HIV RNA following LRA treatment.

We aimed to investigate whether M-ATRIA-RS was an independent predictor of mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 and compare its discrimination capability with CHADS, CHA2DS2-VASc, and modified CHA2DS2-VASc (mCHA2DS2-VASc)-RS. A total of 1,001 patients were retrospectively analyzed and classified into three groups based on M-ATRIA-RS, designed by changing sex criteria of ATRIA-RS from female to male: Group 1 for points 0-1 (n=448), Group 2 for points 2-4 (n=268), and Group 3 for points ≥5 (n=285). Clinical outcomes were defined as in-hospital mortality, need for high-flow oxygen and/or intubation, and admission to intensive care unit. As the M-ATRIA-RS increased, adverse clinical outcomes significantly increased (Group 1, 6.5%; Group 2, 15.3%; Group 3, 34.4%; p <0.001 mortality for in-hospital). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that M-ATRIA-RS, malignancy, troponin increase, and lactate dehydrogenase were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality (p<0.001, per scale possibility rate for ATRIA-RS 1.2). In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the discriminative ability of M-ATRIA-RS was superior to mCHA2DS2-VASc-RS and ATRIA-RS, but similar to that Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score (AUC(M-ATRIA) vs AUC(ATRIA) Z-test=3.14 p=0.002, AUC(M-ATRIA)vs. AUC(mCHA2DS2-VASc) Z-test=2.14, p=0.03; AUC(M-ATRIA)vs. AUC(CCI) Z-test=1.46 p=0.14).

The aim of the study was to determine whether or not the recruitment-to-inflation (R/I) ratio could differentiate between patients according to the change in lung mechanics during the LRM. METHODS: We evaluated the changes in gas exchange and respiratory mechanics induced by a stepwise LRM at a constant driving pressure of 15 cmH(2)O during pressure-controlled ventilation. We assessed lung recruitability by measuring the R/I ratio. Patients were dichotomized with regard to the median R/I ratio. RESULTS: We included 30 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS and a median [interquartile range] R/I ratio of 0.62 [0.42–0.83]. After the LRM, patients with high recruitability (R/I ratio ≥ 0.62) presented an improvement in the P(a)O(2)/F(i)O(2) ratio, due to significant increase in respiratory system compliance (33 [27–42] vs. 42 [35–60] mL/cmH(2)O; p < 0.001). In low recruitability patients (R/I < 0.62), the increase in P(a)O(2)/F(i)O(2) ratio was associated with a significant decrease in pulse pressure as a surrogate of cardiac output (70 [55–85] vs. 50 [51–67] mmHg; p = 0.01) but not with a significant change in respiratory system compliance (33 [24–47] vs. 35 [25–47] mL/cmH(2)O; p = 0.74). CONCLUSION: After the LRM, patients with high recruitability presented a significant increase in respiratory system compliance (indicating a gain in ventilated area), while those with low recruitability presented a decrease in pulse pressure suggesting a drop in cardiac output and therefore in intrapulmonary shunt.

We showed that 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin B (1–5 μM) dose-dependently promoted DiI-LDL uptake in HepG2 cells by upregulating low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein. In HepG2 cells, 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin B (1–10 μM) dose-dependently enhanced LDLR promoter activity by elevating the mature form of SREBP2 (sterol regulatory element binding protein 2) protein levels on one hand, and inhibited PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) promoter activity by attenuating HNF1α (hepatocyte nuclear factor-1α) protein levels in nuclei on the other hand. Consequently, the expression of LDLR protein markedly increased, whereas the PCSK9-mediated LDLR protein degradation decreased. In a high-cholesterol LVG golden Syrian Hamster model, administration of 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin B (30 mg · kg(−1)⋅ d(−1), intragastric, for 3 weeks) significantly decreased the serum LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. PCSK9 protein levels in the serum and liver tissues were significantly decreased, whereas LDLR protein levels in liver tissues were significantly increased in the treated animals as compared with the control animals. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin B exhibits dual transcriptional regulation of LDLR and PCSK9 in HepG2 cells by increasing SREBP2 protein levels and decreasing HNF1α protein levels in the nuclei.

Statins are foundational lipid-lowering therapeutics for cardiovascular disease and also possess beneficial immune-modulating properties. Because of these immune-modulating properties, some have suggested their use in COVID-19. We sought to investigate the association between statin use and mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: Five thousand three hundred seventy-five COVID-19 patients admitted to Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in New York between February 27, 2020, and December 3, 2020, were included in this analysis. Statin use was classified as either non-user, low-to-moderate-intensity user, or high-intensity user. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate in-hospital mortality rate. Considered covariates were age, sex, race, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Compared to non-statin users, both low-to-moderate-intensity (adjusted hazard ratio; aHR 0.62, 95% confidential intervals; CI 0.51–0.76) and high-intensity statin users (aHR 0.53, 95% CI 0.43–0.65) had a reduced risk of death. Subgroup analysis of 723 coronary artery disease patients showed decreased mortality among high-intensity statin users compared to non-users (aHR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36–0.71). CONCLUSIONS: Statin use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was associated with a reduced in-hospital mortality. The protective effect of statin was greater in those with coronary artery disease. These data support continued use of statin therapy in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials are needed to prospectively determine if statin use is effective in lowering the mortality in COVID-19 and other viral infections.

After the femoral head suffers avascular necrosis, the transplanted MSCs undergo a great deal of stress-induced apoptosis and senescence in this microenvironment. So, survival and differentiation of MSCs in osteonecrotic areas are especially important in ONFH. Although MSCs and endothelial cells (ECs) co-culture enhancing proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and form more mature vasculature in vivo, it remains unknown whether the co-culture cells are able to repair ONFH. In this study, we explored the roles and mechanisms of co-transplantation of angiotensin II (Ang II)-MSCs and ECs in repairing early ONFH. In vitro, when MSCs and ECs were co-cultured in a ratio of 5:1, both types of cells managed to proliferate and induce both osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Then, we established a rabbit model of steroid-induced ONFH and co-transplantation of Ang II-MSCs and ECs through the tunnel of core decompression. Four weeks later, histological and Western blot analyses revealed that ONFH treated with Ang II-MSCs and ECs may promote ossification and revascularization by increasing the expression of collagen type I, runt-related transcription factor 2, osteocalcin, and vascular endothelial growth factor in the femoral head. Our data suggest that co-transplantation of Ang II-MSCs and ECs was able to rescue the early steroid-induced ONFH via promoting osteogenesis and angiogenesis, which may be regarded as a novel therapy for the treatment of ONFH in a clinical setting.",2022-03-21,"Zhao, Jingjing; He, Wei; Zheng, Hongqing; Zhang, Rui; Yang, Hao",Cell Transplant,,document_parses/pdf_json/c293d25244807812f47b1599628159497d0d0775.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35313737/; https://doi.org/10.1177/09636897221086965,247598669.0,2022,248

Hospital or secondary care contact may present a ‘teachable moment’ to provide parents with support to change their home smoking behaviours to reduce children’s SHSe. There is a lack of robust qualitative evidence around parents and healthcare professionals (HCPs) views on using this teachable moment to successfully initiate behavioural change. We aim to identify and understand what is important to stakeholders with a view to informing the development of a support package to help parents change their home smoking behaviours. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This qualitative study will be theoretically underpinned by the Capability, Opportunity and Motivation Behaviour (COM-B) model of behavioural change. It will involve semistructured interviews and/or discussion groups with up to 20 parents who smoke and up to 25 HCPs. Stakeholders will be recruited from a single National Health Service children’s hospital in England. Interviews and/or discussion groups will be audio recorded, transcribed and anonymised. The transcripts and any field notes will be analysed using the framework method. Initially, we will apply COM-B to the data deductively and will then code inductively within each domain. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The protocol for this study received a favourable outcome from the East Midlands Leicester Central Research Ethics Committee (19/EM/0171).

Here, we provide evidence that antibodies play a role in the worsening of disease at the time of seroconversion. We show that early phase severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein-specific IgG in serum of critically ill COVID-19 patients induces excessive inflammatory responses by human alveolar macrophages. We identified that this excessive inflammatory response is dependent on two antibody features that are specific for patients with severe COVID-19. First, inflammation is driven by high titers of anti-spike IgG, a hallmark of severe disease. Second, we found that anti-spike IgG from patients with severe COVID-19 is intrinsically more pro-inflammatory because of different glycosylation, particularly low fucosylation, of the antibody Fc tail. Notably, low fucosylation of anti-spike IgG was normalized in a few weeks after initial infection with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the increased antibody-dependent inflammation mainly occurs at the time of seroconversion. We identified Fcγ Receptor (FcγR) IIa and FcγRIII as the two primary IgG receptors that are responsible for the induction of key COVID-19-associated cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor. In addition, we show that anti-spike IgG-activated human macrophages can subsequently break pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity and induce microvascular thrombosis in vitro.

The primary aim of this study was to assess the effects of PEEP augmentation on respiratory mechanics, quantitative computed lung tomography (qCT) findings, and its relationship with ICP modifications. Secondary aims included the assessment of the correlations between different factors (respiratory mechanics and qCT features) with the changes of ICP and how these factors at baseline may predict ICP response after greater PEEP levels. Methods: A prospective, observational study included mechanically ventilated patients with acute brain injury requiring invasive ICP and who underwent two-PEEP levels lung CT scan. Respiratory system compliance (Crs), arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)), mean arterial pressure (MAP), data from qCT and ICP were obtained at PEEP 5 and 15 cmH(2)O. Results: Sixteen examinations (double PEEP lung CT and neuromonitoring) in 15 patients were analyzed. The median age of the patients was 54 years (interquartile range, IQR = 39–65) and 53% were men. The median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) at intensive care unit (ICU) admission was 8 (IQR = 3–12). Median alveolar recruitment was 2.5% of total lung weight (−1.5 to 4.7). PEEP from 5 to 15 cmH(2)O increased ICP [median values from 14.0 (11.2–17.5) to 23.5 (19.5–26.8) mmHg, p < 0.001, respectively]. The amount of recruited lung tissue on CT was inversely correlated with the change (Δ) in ICP (rho = −0.78; p = 0.0006).

Conclusions: The main factors associated with increased ICP after PEEP augmentation included reduced Crs, lower MAP and lung recruitment, and increased PaCO(2), but none of these factors was able to predict, at baseline, ICP response to PEEP.

ED data are a proven tool for biosurveillance, and the ED data in NC DETECT have proved to be effective for a variety of public health uses, including surveillance, monitoring and investigation. A distinctive feature of ED data for surveillance is their timeliness. With electronic health information systems, these data are available in near real-time, making them particularly useful for surveillance and situational awareness in rapidly developing public health outbreaks or disasters. Challenges to using ED data for biosurveillance include the reliance on free text data (often in chief complaints).

The antimicrobial activity was enhanced by heat and maintained active over a wide range of pH (2.0–8.0). Moreover, the crude extract (CE) showed inhibitory activity against several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The molecular weight of partially purified precipitated bacteriocin-like substances (BLISs) was about 14 kDa in 20% Tricine-SDS-PAGE.

Access to maternal health services (MHS) was disrupted during the epidemic, with reductions in antenatal care, facility-based deliveries and postnatal care. We aimed to identify and describe barriers related to the uptake and provision of MHS during the 2014–2016 EVD outbreak in West Africa. METHODS: In June 2020, we conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed publications and grey literature from relevant stakeholder organisations. Search terms were generated to identify literature that explained underlying access barriers to MHS. Published literature in scientific journals was first searched and extracted from PubMed and Web of Science databases for the period between 1 January 2014 and 27 June 2020. We hand-searched relevant stakeholder websites. A ‘snowball’ approach was used to identify relevant sources uncaptured in the systematic search. The identified literature was examined to synthesise themes using an existing framework. RESULTS: Nineteen papers were included, with 26 barriers to MHS uptake and provision identified. Three themes emerged: (1) fear and mistrust, (2) health system and service constraints, and (3) poor communication. Our analysis of the literature indicates that fear, experienced by both service users and providers, was the most recurring barrier to MHS. Constrained health systems negatively impacted MHS on the supply side. Poor communication and inadequately coordinated training efforts disallowed competent provision of MHS. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to accessing MHS during the EVD outbreak in West Africa were influenced by complex but inter-related factors at the individual, interpersonal, health system and international level. Future responses to EVD outbreaks need to address underlying reasons for fear and mistrust between patients and providers, and ensure MHS are adequately equipped both routinely and during crises.",2020-09-06,"Yerger, Piper; Jalloh, Mohamed; Coltart, Cordelia E M; King, Carina",BMJ Glob Health,,document_parses/pdf_json/dee93df95b72d2eb051c702c686e65e6a65db55a.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32895217/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002974,221541455.0,2020,301

It can also support evaluating and comparing of prospective intervention strategies in terms of e.g. lockdown in certain areas or isolation of specific age groups. The simplified model is a discrete time-invariant linear system that has cumulative infectious incidence, infected population, asymptomatic population, exposed population, and infectious pressure as the state variables. Since the system matrix of the model depends on a number transition rates, structural properties of the model are investigated for suitable parameter ranges.

The current study's overall aim was to examine the impact of the current COVID-19 outbreak on the number of non-COVID-related patient presentations to a major national emergency traumatology/orthopedics referral center in Latin America. Methods: An observational study was performed at one of Peru's main tertiary trauma referral centers, during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Numbers of non-follow-up patients presenting to the traumatology/ orthopedics service were counted and compared between January through April 2019 and January through April 2020; and between the month immediately prior to the Peruvian government's implementation of national lock-down measures (Feb 16—Mar 15; Period 1) and the month immediately following (Mar 16—Apr 15; Period 2). The number of surgery service hospitalizations also was compared pre- versus post lockdown initiation (Period 1 vs. 2), as were patient characteristics and outcomes, like age, sex, discharge disposition, mortality, indications for hospital admission, and COVID-19 status. Results: Comparing 2019 and 2020, no appreciable differences were detected in the number of patients seen in either January or February. However, relative to March and April 2019, the numbers of patients seen in March and April 2020 (the two months after the first Peruvian case of COVID-19 was detected) were reduced by 55.8 and 88.6%, respectively. Comparing the months immediately pre and post lockdown, the number of service patients declined by 79.9% in April, while the number of hospitalizations declined by 30.9%. The number of admissions for various surgical indications either remained stable or declined in parallel with the overall decline in admissions for all indications except for osteoporotic hip fractures and diabetic foot ulcers (both of which increased proportional to the overall number of admissions) and for hand and foot fractures, both of which decreased. Conclusion: At our hospital, not all indications for traumatology/orthopedics service utilization declined despite the national government's directive to reduce non-COVID-related consultations and admissions.

Existing curricula emphasize tenets of patient safety but rarely address the impact of medical errors on health care providers, particularly at the undergraduate level. The authors developed an interactive session exploring the professional and personal effects of medical errors for 300 second-year medical students. METHODS: The session utilized case-based learning, small group discussion, and video vignettes. Physicians in multiple specialties were interviewed, sharing narrative accounts of their experience with medical errors and adverse events. Discussions were facilitated by local physicians, who delivered content and shared personal anecdotes. Surveys using a 5-point Likert scale were conducted before and after the session. RESULTS: Pre- and post-test surveys resulted in 91 responses in 2016 and 174 in 2017. In 2016, results showed significant change in student responses by 0.34 units (SD 0.35 units; p < 0.001). Two survey items addressing student awareness and three items addressing confidence were significant. The domains assessing students’ attitudes and knowledge regarding medical errors were not significant. In 2017, the overall mean change was 0.33 with a lower standard error, 0.03 (p < 0.001), showing significance in both years the session was delivered.

Mild central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, such as headache and drowsiness, can result from systemically elevated cytokine levels and therefore are common in many virus infections, even in the absence of the infection of the CNS. CNS infection is quite unusual and is initiated either as a result of the viremia or, more rarely, as a result of neural spread. The poliovirus infects the anterior horn motor neurons of the spinal cord, causing poliomyelitis, the disease for which the virus is named. DNA vaccination is a relatively new entrant in the vaccine sweepstakes, but is viewed with optimism, for a number of reasons. DNA vaccines encoding the nucleoprotein from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus can confer protection against the normally lethal intracranial challenge. In rabies, in a mouse model, immunization with plasmids encoding the rabies glycoprotein conferred complete protection against subsequent viral challenge.

The unoptimized studies not only raise the process cost but also complicate the physicochemical characteristics of the nanostructures. The liquid–plasma reduction with optimized synthesis parameters is an environmentally friendly and low-cost technique for the synthesis of a range of nanomaterials. This work is focused on the statistically optimized production of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by using a liquid–plasma reduction process sustained with an argon plasma jet. A simplex centroid design (SCD) was made in Minitab statistical package to optimize the combined effect of stabilizers on the structural growth and UV absorbance of AgNPs. Different combinations of glucose, fructose, sucrose and lactose stabilizers were tested at five different levels (−2, −1, 0, 1, 2) in SCD. The effect of individual and mixed stabilizers on AgNPs growth parameters was assumed significant when p-value in SCD is less than 0.05. A surface plasmon resonance band was fixed at 302 nm after SCD optimization of UV results. A bond stretching at 1633 cm(−1) in FTIR spectra was assigned to C=O, which slightly shifts towards a larger wavelength in the presence of saccharides in the solution. The presence of FCC structured AgNPs with an average size of 15 nm was confirmed from XRD and EDX spectra under optimized conditions.

The nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays an outstanding neurobiological role in opioid addiction as a part of the striatum and key component of brain reward system. The striatal GABAergic medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs) are the main neuronal type in the NAc where addiction-specific synaptic plasticity occurs. The activity of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription is crucial for neural plasticity and molecular studies suggest its increase in the NAc of heroin addicts. Silver-stained argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region (AgNOR) areas visualised in neuronal nuclei in paraffin-embedded brain sections are reliable morphological estimators of rDNA transcription and thus surrogate markers for the activity of brain regions. Our study revealed increased AgNOR areas in MSNs of the left NAc in 11 heroin addicts versus 11 healthy controls from the Magdeburg Brain Bank (U-test P = 0.007). No differences were observed in another investigated part of the striatum, namely the head of caudate nucleus, which is located closely to the NAc. The results were not confounded by significant differences in the age, brain volume and time of formalin fixation existing between compared groups. Our findings suggest an increased NAc activity in heroin addicts, which is consistent with human and animal experimental data.

Compared to the same period in 2017–2019, the daily O3 mean concentrations increased at urban stations by 24% in Nice, 14% in Rome, 27% in Turin, 2.4% in Valencia and 36% in Wuhan during the lockdown in 2020. This increase in O3 concentrations is mainly explained by an unprecedented reduction in NOx emissions leading to a lower O3 titration by NO. Strong reductions in NO2 mean concentrations were observed in all European cities, ~53% at urban stations, comparable to Wuhan (57%), and ~65% at traffic stations. NO declined even further, ~63% at urban stations and ~78% at traffic stations in Europe. Reductions in PM2.5 and PM10 at urban stations were overall much smaller both in magnitude and relative change in Europe (~8%) than in Wuhan (~42%). The PM reductions due to limiting transportation and fuel combustion in institutional and commercial buildings were partly offset by increases of PM emissions from the activities at home in some of the cities. The NOx concentrations during the lockdown were on average 49% lower than those at weekends of the previous years in all cities. The lockdown effect on O3 production was ~10% higher than the weekend effect in Southern Europe and 38% higher in Wuhan, while for PM the lockdown had the same effect as weekends in Southern Europe (~6% of difference).

Others have argued that democratic governments have generally failed relative to more autocratic ones, simply because autocrats can make the hard choices required for stemming the spread of viruses. We address this question by asking whether more ‘egalitarian’ forms of democracy matter, given that they contain more equitable health-care access and societal infrastructure, such as social capital and trust. METHODS: We use standard regression techniques, including instrumental variables analysis addressing endogeneity on COVID-19 testing and deaths data as of the end of May and beginning of September. We use novel data from the Varieties of Democracy Project on health-system equity and egalitarian democracy. RESULTS: Our results suggest that more equitable access to health care increases testing rates and lowers the death rate from COVID-19. Broader egalitarian governance, measured as egalitarian democracy, however, shows the opposite effect. Thus, factors associated with health-care capacity to reach and treat matter more than broader societal factors associated with social capital and trust. The results are robust to alternative testing procedures, including instrumental variable technique for addressing potential endogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a great deal of public health focus on how equitable governance helps fight the adverse effects of so-called neoliberal pandemics, we find that broadly egalitarian factors have had the opposite effect on fighting COVID-19, especially when an equitable health system has been taken into account. Fighting disease, thus, might be more about the capacity of health systems rather than societal factors, such as trust in government and social capital.",2021-01-09,"Vadlamannati, Krishna Chaitanya; Cooray, Arusha; de Soysa, Indra",Scand J Public Health,,document_parses/pdf_json/7e54c0a12c3de031753136110b5ecc779577e515.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33427079/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1403494820982106,231574536.0,2021,274

A non-targeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC–MS)-based metabolomics analysis was used to identify metabolic changes associated with NAFLD in humans upon exercise intervention (without diet change) across four different sample types—adipose tissue (AT), plasma, urine, and stool. Altogether, 46 subjects with NAFLD participated in this randomized controlled intervention study. The intervention group (n = 21) performed high-intensity interval training (HIIT) for 12 weeks while the control group (n = 25) kept their sedentary lifestyle. The participants' clinical parameters and metabolic profiles were compared between baseline and endpoint. HIIT significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose concentration (p = 0.027) and waist circumference (p = 0.028); and increased maximum oxygen consumption rate and maximum achieved workload (p < 0.001). HIIT resulted in sample-type-specific metabolite changes, including accumulation of amino acids and their derivatives in AT and plasma, while decreasing in urine and stool. Moreover, many of the metabolite level changes especially in the AT were correlated with the clinical parameters monitored during the intervention. In addition, certain lipids increased in plasma and decreased in the stool. Glyco-conjugated bile acids decreased in AT and urine. The 12-week HIIT exercise intervention has beneficial ameliorating effects in NAFLD subjects on a whole-body level, even without dietary changes and weight loss. The metabolomics analysis applied to the four different sample matrices provided an overall view on several metabolic pathways that had tissue-type specific changes after HIIT intervention in subjects with NAFLD. The results highlight especially the role of AT in responding to the HIIT challenge, and suggest that altered amino acid metabolism in AT might play a critical role in e.g. improving fasting plasma glucose concentration.

Major components of rabies elimination programs leading to these successes have been constant and regular surveillance for rabid dogs and uninterrupted yearly mass dog vaccination campaigns. Unfortunately, vital measures to control COVID-19 have had the negative trade-off of jeopardizing these rabies elimination and prevention activities. We aimed to assess the effect of interrupting canine rabies surveillance and mass dog vaccination campaigns on rabies trends. We built a deterministic compartment model of dog rabies dynamics to create a conceptual framework for how different disruptions may affect rabies virus transmission. We parameterized the model for conditions found in Arequipa, Peru, a city with active rabies virus transmission. We examined our results over a range of plausible values for R(0) (1.36–2.0). Also, we prospectively evaluated surveillance data during the pandemic to detect temporal changes. Our model suggests that a decrease in canine vaccination coverage as well as decreased surveillance could lead to a sharp rise in canine rabies within months. These results were consistent over all plausible values of R(0). Surveillance data from late 2020 and early 2021 confirms that in Arequipa, Peru, rabies cases are on an increasing trajectory. The rising rabies trends in Arequipa, if indicative to the region as whole, suggest that the achievements made in Latin America towards the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies may be in jeopardy.",2021-05-21,"Raynor, Brinkley; Díaz, Elvis W.; Shinnick, Julianna; Zegarra, Edith; Monroy, Ynes; Mena, Claudia; De la Puente-León, Micaela; Levy, Michael Z.; Castillo-Neyra, Ricardo",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,document_parses/pdf_json/7dd300edfdfe1adc57b5caa8e26d9734285164c9.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34019548/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0009414,235094852.0,2021,231

Digits-in-noise (DIN) is a reliable speech-in-noise test that can be self-administered remotely. This study investigated the predictive validity of a self-administered DIN test and a commonly used self-report, the speech, spatial, and qualities of hearing (SSQ-12), for lab-based, supervised DIN and audiometry. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) of 34 adults (18-64 y/o), 16 normal-hearing (NH) and 18 hearing-impaired (HI), were measured at home (remote-DIN) and in the lab (lab-DIN). All DIN testing used English digits 0-9, binaurally presented as triplets in different speech-shaped noise maskers (broadband, low-pass filtered at 2, 4, 8 kHz). Audiometry was administered during lab testing. An SSQ-12 e-version was completed by participants at home. As expected, NH listeners had significantly higher SSQ scores, and remote- and lab-DIN SRTs than HI listeners. All test versions of DIN were significantly correlated with pure-tone-average (PTA), with the 2-kHz filtered test the best predictor, explaining 50% of variance in PTA. SSQ also significantly predicted PTA. Overall, DIN-SRTs were better predictors of audiograms than the SSQ. Remote-DIN correlated significantly with lab-DIN, and there was no significant mean difference between remote- and lab-DIN. Test-retest reliability was measured for broadband remote-DIN. High, significant intraclass correlation coefficients indicated strong internal consistency of the remote-DIN.

By studying the spatiotemporal associations of febrile patients, it may allow early detection of case clustering that indicates imminent threat of infectious disease outbreaks in the community. METHODS: We captured consecutive emergency department visits that led to hospitalization in a district hospital in Hong Kong during the period of 12 Sep 2005 to 14 Oct 2005. We recorded demographic data, provisional diagnoses, temperature on presentation and residential location for each patient-episode, and geocoded the residential addresses. We applied Geographical Information System technology to study the geographical distribution these cases, and their associations within a 50-m buffer zone spatially. A case cluster was defined by three or more spatially associated febrile patients within each three consecutive days. RESULTS: One thousand and sixty six patient-episodes were eligible for analysis; 42% of them had fever (>37°C; oral temperature) on presentation. Two hundred and four patient-episodes (19.1%) came from residential care homes for elderly (RCHE). We detected a total of 40 case clusters during the study period.

Healthcare professionals, patients, healthy individuals, and the whole community are under inevitable psychological pressure which may cause different psychological problems as fear, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. The aim was to assess the impact of the COVID19 pandemic on the attitude, behavior, and mental health of rheumatic patients and to compare them with healthy individuals. This is a case-control study, 360 participants were included and divided into a patient group composed of 180 patients with rheumatic diseases, and a control group composed of 180 healthy people. Data were collected via a self-administered structured questionnaire designed on Google forms. It was sent to participants via social networks and emails to different rheumatic patients and healthy individuals. Mental health was measured by the 5-item Brief Symptom Rating Scale (BSRS-5). RESULTS: The mean age of cases and control were (35.05 ± 8.79 vs 34.56 ± 9.06) years. In comparing attitudes and behavior toward COVID 19, there was a statistically significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) between both groups regarding washing hands, going outdoors, wearing masks and gloves outdoors, and staying in their rooms. Patients depended mainly on telehealth more than usual where about 50% used either phone calls, internet or sent their relatives to their physicians; moreover, 20% did not contact their physicians at all the past few months. There was a statistically significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) between both groups regarding feeling angry/irritated, inferior and insomniac. The BSRS-5 total score and being defined as a psychiatric case (according to the BSRS-5 scale) also differed significantly between patients and controls. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients showed more adherence to their medications and stayed mostly at home and they have higher BSRS scores. CONCLUSION: Patients with rheumatic diseases show comparable degrees of anxiety and depression to healthy individuals, but higher distress symptoms and panic in the form of anger, irritability, and insomnia. They have a significantly higher sense of inferiority and a higher total BSRS compared to controls. SLE patients show more adherence to their medications and stay mostly at home as a reflection of feeling more vulnerable. Moreover, they have higher degrees of psychological affection in the form of higher BSRS scores.

Research has highlighted advantages and disadvantages of each of these medications, but there remains an absence of qualitative evidence regarding the lived experiences of AF patients. The present study helps address this gap and obtain a greater understanding of the patient experience and beliefs surrounding their anticoagulant medication. METHOD Semi-structured qualitative interviews with a purposive sample of 20 participants (10 warfarin, 10 rivaroxaban). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. RESULTS Data analysis led to the generation of three key themes: positive perceptions of medication, distrust of alternatives, and inconsistencies in support experiences. CONCLUSIONS Positive perceptions of one anticoagulant medication (ACM) and distrust of alternatives may influence patients' confidence in switching medications.

Further, spin can be a potent energy source for powering relativistic jets and energetic particle acceleration. In this review, I describe the techniques currently used to detect and measure the spins of black holes. It is shown that: (1) Two well understood techniques, X-ray reflection spectroscopy and thermal continuum fitting, can be used to measure the spins of black holes that are accreting at moderate rates. There is a rich set of other electromagnetic techniques allowing us to extend spin measurements to lower accretion rates. (2) Many accreting supermassive black holes are found to be rapidly-spinning, although a population of more slowly spinning black holes emerges at masses above $M>3\times 10^7\,M_\odot$ as expected from recent structure formation models. (3) Many accreting stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems are rapidly spinning and must have been born in this state. (4) The advent of gravitational wave astronomy has enabled the detection of spin effects in merging binary black holes. Most of the pre-merger black holes are found to be slowly spinning, a notable exception being an object that may itself be a merger product. (5) The stark difference in spins between the black hole X-ray binary and the binary black hole populations shows that there is a diversity of formation mechanisms. Given the array of new electromagnetic and gravitational wave capabilities currently being planned, the future of black hole spin studies is bright.",2020-11-17,"Reynolds, Christopher S.",,,document_parses/pdf_json/d648efb8502bbc414b7c12e19db60d77b8b81d42.json,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08948v1.pdf,227013041.0,2020,259

This high mortality rate leads many providers to feel that the treatment of pTBI is futile. Contrary to this point of view, several studies have shown that victims of pTBI who present with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≥6 have a reasonable chance of a meaningful outcome. This study sought to investigate outcomes of pTBI patients based on GCS score who underwent neurosurgical intervention (craniotomy or craniectomy) and compare them with patients who did not undergo surgical intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study represents a secondary analysis of the data that were collected from 2006 to 2016 from 17 institutions as part of a multi-center study, investigating clinical outcomes for adult patients sustaining pTBI and surviving >72 h. Patients were divided into those with GCS 3-5 and those with GCS ≥6. Within these groups, patients were stratified by whether they received surgical intervention, compared with standard non-surgical care. Patient level data (age and gender), clinical data (Injury Severity Score and Abbreviated Injury Score), GCS on admission, post-op infection rates, and outcomes data (mortality, length of stay [LOS], intensive care unit LOS) were collected. Both groups were compared using independent sample t-test or chi-squared test. RESULTS Seven hundred twenty patients with pTBI were identified over 11 y, out of which 336 (46.7%) underwent surgery. The mean Injury Severity Score and Abbreviated Injury Score on admission were higher in the surgical intervention group than their non-surgical counterpart in patients with a GCS ≥6 (P < 0.0001). Patients with GCS of 3-5 with surgical intervention demonstrated a higher survival rate than non-surgical patients (P < 0.0001). In the GCS ≥6 group, surgical intervention did not impact near-term mortality. Intensive care unit LOS was significantly longer in the surgical intervention group in patients with GCS ≥ 6 (P < 0.0001) and GCS of 3-5 (P < 0.0001), as was total hospital LOS (P < 0.0001). Patients with a GCS 3-5 and ≥6 who underwent surgical intervention were more likely to develop a central nervous system infection (P = 0.016; P = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS Surgical intervention in pTBI patients with GCS 3-5 results in improved mortality but comes at a cost of increased resource utilization in the form of longer LOS and higher infection rate. On the other hand, in patients with GCS ≥6, surgery does not provide significant benefits in patient survival. Future prospective studies providing insight as to the impact of surgery on the resource utilization and quality of survival would be beneficial in determining the need for surgical intervention in this population.",2020-08-17,"D'Agostino, Robyn; Kursinskis, Alexandra; Parikh, Priti; Letarte, Peter; Harmon, Laura; Semon, Gregory",The Journal of surgical research,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2020.07.046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818778/,221222218.0,2020,440

In this study two 1‑hour cycles with patient care-related tasks with PPE and PPE + cooling-wear, respectively, were conducted. A third cycle with scrubs exclusively served as baseline/negative control. The assessment occurred immediately pre-cycles and post-cycles. RESULTS: Pre-cycle assessments showed no significant differences between the cycles. After PPE cycle, increased physical stress levels and decrements in concentration capacity were observed. Physiological parameters were significantly less affected in the cooling cycle, while concentration capacity slightly increased. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 PPE causes considerable thermal stress, ultimately affecting human performance.

Data describing post-hospital discharge outcomes may provide insight into disease course. Studies describing post-hospitalization outcomes of adults following COVID-19 infection are limited to electronic medical record review, which may underestimate the incidence of outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine 30-day post-hospitalization outcomes following COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study SETTING: Quaternary referral hospital and community hospital in New York City. PARTICIPANTS: COVID-19 infected patients discharged alive from the emergency department (ED) or hospital between March 3 and May 15, 2020. MEASUREMENT: Outcomes included return to an ED, re-hospitalization, and mortality within 30 days of hospital discharge. RESULTS: Thirty-day follow-up data were successfully collected on 94.6% of eligible patients. Among 1344 patients, 16.5% returned to an ED, 9.8% were re-hospitalized, and 2.4% died. Among patients who returned to the ED, 50.0% (108/216) went to a different hospital from the hospital of the index presentation, and 61.1% (132/216) of those who returned were re-hospitalized. In Cox models adjusted for variables selected using the lasso method, age (HR 1.01 per year [95% CI 1.00–1.02]), diabetes (1.54 [1.06–2.23]), and the need for inpatient dialysis (3.78 [2.23–6.43]) during the index presentation were independently associated with a higher re-hospitalization rate. Older age (HR 1.08 [1.05–1.11]) and Asian race (2.89 [1.27–6.61]) were significantly associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients discharged alive following their index presentation for COVID-19, risk for returning to a hospital within 30 days of discharge was substantial. These patients merit close post-discharge follow-up to optimize outcomes.

Sarcoidosis affects 45–300/100 000 individuals in the USA and has an increasing mortality rate. The greatest gap in knowledge about sarcoidosis pathobiology is a lack of understanding about the underlying immunological mechanisms driving progressive pulmonary disease. The objective of this study is to define the lung-specific and blood-specific longitudinal changes in the adaptive immune response and their relationship to progressive and non-progressive pulmonary outcomes in patients with recently diagnosed sarcoidosis. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The BRonchoscopy at Initial sarcoidosis diagnosis Targeting longitudinal Endpoints study is a US-based, NIH-sponsored longitudinal blood and bronchoscopy study. Enrolment will occur over four centres with a target sample size of 80 eligible participants within 18 months of tissue diagnosis. Participants will undergo six study visits over 18 months. In addition to serial measurement of lung function, symptom surveys and chest X-rays, participants will undergo collection of blood and two bronchoscopies with bronchoalveolar lavage separated by 6 months. Freshly processed samples will be stained and flow-sorted for isolation of CD4 +T helper (Th1, Th17.0 and Th17.1) and T regulatory cell immune populations, followed by next-generation RNA sequencing.

For the widespread adoption of new technology, it must be locally demonstrable and become normalized. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to install smart speakers in care homes in a rural and coastal region and to explore if and how the devices were being used, the barriers to their implementation, and their potential benefits. METHODS: Email, workshops, drop-in sessions, phone, and cold calling was used to contact all 230 care homes, offering a free smart speaker and some advisory support. Care homes accepting the devices were asked to complete a feedback diary. Nonresponse rate for diary completion was high and was thus supplemented with a telephone survey. RESULTS: Over the course of 7 months, we installed 156 devices in 92 care homes for older people, 50 devices for people with physical or mental health needs, and 8 for others. The devices were used mainly for music but also for poetry, recipes, light controls, jokes, and video calls. Care home managers reported the benefits for the residents, including enhanced engagement with home activities, enjoyment, calming effects, and the acquisition of new skills. Implementation problems included internet connectivity, staff capacity, and skills. CONCLUSIONS: Affordable consumer devices such as smart speakers should be installed in all care homes to benefit residents. Voice-activated technologies are easy to use and promote interaction.

Triage via telemedicine could deter unnecessary ED transfers. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effectiveness of a telemedicine intervention for emergency triage in an independent living community. METHODS: In the intervention community, a 950-resident independent senior living community, when a resident called for help, emergency medical technician–trained staff could engage an emergency medicine physician via telemedicine to assist with management and triage. We compared trends in the proportion of calls resulting in transport to the ED (ie, primary outcome) in the intervention community to two control communities. Secondary outcomes were telemedicine use and posttransport disposition. Semistructured focus groups of residents and staff were conducted to examine attitudes toward the intervention. Qualitative data analysis used thematic analysis. RESULTS: Although the service was offered at no cost to residents, use was low and we found no evidence of fewer ED transfers. The key barrier to program use was resistance from frontline staff members, who did not view telemedicine triage as a valuable tool for emergency response, instead perceiving it as time-consuming and as undermining their independent judgment.

Overall, 82 of 471 air samples (17.4%) from close patient environments were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, with a significantly higher positivity rate in intensive care unit settings (intensive care unit, 27 of 107 [25.2%] vs non–intensive care unit, 39 of 364 [10.7%]; P < .001). There was no difference according to the distance from patients (≤1 m, 3 of 118 [2.5%] vs >1-5 m, 13 of 236 [5.5%]; P = .22). The positivity rate was 5 of 21 air samples (23.8%) in toilets, 20 of 242 (8.3%) in clinical areas, 15 of 122 (12.3%) in staff areas, and 14 of 42 (33.3%) in public areas. A total of 81 viral cultures were performed across 5 studies, and 7 (8.6%) from 2 studies were positive, all from close patient environments. The median (interquartile range) SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations varied from 1.0 × 10(3) copies/m(3) (0.4 × 10(3) to 3.1 × 10(3) copies/m(3)) in clinical areas to 9.7 × 10(3) copies/m(3) (5.1 × 10(3) to 14.3 × 10(3) copies/m(3)) in the air of toilets or bathrooms. Protective equipment removal and patient rooms had high concentrations per titer of SARS-CoV-2 (varying from 0.9 × 10(3) to 40 × 10(3) copies/m(3) and 3.8 × 10(3) to 7.2 × 10(3) TCID50/m(3)), with aerosol size distributions that showed peaks in the region of particle size less than 1 μm; staff offices had peaks in the region of particle size greater than 4 μm. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review, the air close to and distant from patients with coronavirus disease 2019 was frequently contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA; however, few of these samples contained viable viruses. High viral loads found in toilets and bathrooms, staff areas, and public hallways suggest that these areas should be carefully considered.",2020-12-23,"Birgand, Gabriel; Peiffer-Smadja, Nathan; Fournier, Sandra; Kerneis, Solen; Lescure, François-Xavier; Lucet, Jean-Christophe",JAMA Netw Open,,,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.33232; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355679/,229689373.0,2020,481

UHC aims to provide everyone with equal access to quality essential and comprehensive healthcare services including preventions, interventions, and treatments, without exposing them to financial hardship. Making progress toward UHC requires significant investment in technical and financial resources and countries are pursuing the implementation of cost-saving measures within health systems to help them achieve UHC. Whilst many countries are far from attaining UHC, all countries, particularly low- and middle-income countries, can take steps toward achieving UHC. This paper discusses key data showing how immunization is a fundamental, cost-effective tool for reducing morbidity and mortality associated with infectious disease in all populations, creating more productive communities, reducing treatment costs, and consequently, facilitating social and economic advancement. Immunization is key to advancing toward UHC by relieving the burden that diseases place on the healthcare services, freeing essential resources to use elsewhere within the healthcare system.

In this study, fine broken rice grains were used to produce rice flour and subsequently rice‐based biscuits. The biscuits were further fortified with safou powder, and the physical, nutritional, and sensory quality and stability during storage of the different types of biscuits were analyzed using standard methods. Fine or nonsandy biscuits had peak particle size of 500 µm, while medium (slightly sandy) and large (sandy) biscuits had peak particle sizes of 1,000 µm and 1,400 µm, respectively. The hardness varied from 5.7 ± 2.3 N for biscuits with large particles to 16.1 ± 4.4 N for biscuits with fine particles. Fortification of biscuits with sour safou increased the protein and amino acid content of the biscuits. Tryptophan was absent in both safou and the biscuits produced. There was an increase in phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper, iron, manganese, and aluminum following fortification with safou. Nonsandy biscuits dissolved faster in the mouth (melt) during consumption than the other biscuits although most of the biscuits were perceived to be low in melting and buttery. Nonsandy biscuits were rated as “very good,” while slightly sandy and sandy were rated as “good.” Safou rice‐based biscuits were perceived as “very good,” while simple rice biscuits were perceived as “good.” Fortification of rice biscuits with safou increased the protein, essential amino acid, and mineral contents of the biscuits with very appreciable taste.

S. viridis was unable to survive exposed to sodium chloride (NaCl) levels higher than 100 mM, in contrast, S. alterniflora could tolerate NaCl up to 550 mM, with negligible effect on gas exchange related parameters and conductance of electrons transport chain (gETC). Under salt, the prompt fluorescence (OJIP-curves) exhibits an increase in the O- and J-steps in S. viridis and much less for S. alterniflora. Flowing NaCl stress, a dramatic decline in the photosystem II (PSII) primary photochemistry was observed for S. viridis, as reflected by the drastic drop in Fv/Fm, Fv/Fo and ΦPSII; however, no substantial change was recorded for these parameters in S. alterniflora. Interestingly, we found an increase in the primary PSII photochemistry (ΦPSII) for S. alterniflora with increasing either NaCl concentration or NaCl treatment duration. The NPQ magnitude was strongly enhanced for S. viridis even at a low NaCl (50 mM); however, it remains unchangeable or slightly increased for S. alterniflora at NaCl levels above 400 mM. After NaCl treatment, we found an increase in both the proportion of oxidized P700 and the amount of active P700 in S. viridis and almost no change for S. alterniflora. Under salt, the net photosynthetic rate (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) measurements demonstrate that A decreases earlier in S. viridis, even after one week exposure to only 50 mM NaCl; in contrast, in S. alterniflora, the effect of NaCl on A and gs was minor even after exposure for two weeks to high NaCl levels. For S. viridis exposed to 50 mM NaCl for 12 d, carbon dioxide (CO2) at a concentration of 2000 μL L-1 could not fully restore A to the control (Ctrl) level. Conversely, in S. alterniflora, high CO2 can fully restore A for all NaCl treatments except at 550 mM. RNA-seq data shows a major impact of NaCl on metabolic pathways in S. viridis and we found a number of transcription factors potentially related to NaCl responses. For S. alterniflora, no major changes in the transcriptomic levels were recorded under NaCl stress. To confirm our data analysis of RNA-seq, we performed quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis for randomly selected four genes for each species (8 genes in total) and we found that our results (up- and/or down-regulated genes) are fully consistent and match well our RNA-seq data. Overall, this study showed drastically different photosynthetic and transcriptomic responses of a salt-tolerant C4 grass species and one salt-sensitive C4 grass species to NaCl stress, which suggests that S. alterniflora could be used as a promising model species to study salt tolerance in C4 or monocot species.",2020-08-01,"Essemine, Jemaa; Qu, Mingnan; Lyu, Ming-Ju Amy; Song, Qingfeng; Khan, Naveed; Chen, Genyun; Wang, Peng; Zhu, Xin-Guang",Journal of plant physiology,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2020.153244; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818766/,221220292.0,2020,463

However, while many traditional dieting, food tracking and weight loss coaching programs result in short-term weight loss, there is less evidence of their effectiveness on sustaining weight loss over time. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 1,740 adults with obesity who used Foodsmart, a digital personalized dietary assessment, meal planning and food purchasing platform. Participants reported age, gender, at least three measures of weight, and their diet using a food frequency questionnaire. We defined sustained weight loss as participants who lost 5 % of initial weight between their first and second reported weights and lost weight or maintained weight between second and third reported weights. A healthy eating score, Nutriscore, was calculated to assess overall diet quality. We used multivariate logistic regression models to examine the association between user characteristics and odds of sustained weight loss. RESULTS: Over a median of 25 months, the mean (standard deviation) change in weight among participants was − 6.2 (19.8) pounds. In total, 39.3 % (684/1,740) of participants lost at least 5 % of their initial weight, and 22.4 % percent (389/1,740) of participants sustained weight loss.

COVID-19 primarily targets the human respiratory epithelium but also has neuro-invasive potential. Indeed, neuropsychiatric manifestations, such as fatigue, febrile seizures, psychiatric symptoms, and delirium, are consistently observed in COVID-19. The neurobiological basis of neuropsychiatric COVID-19 symptoms is not fully understood. However, previous evidence about systemic viral infections pointed to an ongoing neuroinflammatory response to viral antigens and proinflammatory mediators/immune cells from the periphery. Microglia cells mediate the overproduction of inflammatory cytokines, free radicals, and damage signals, culminating with neurotoxic consequences. Semi-synthetic second-generation tetracyclines, including minocycline (MINO) and doxycycline (DOXY), are safe bacteriostatic agents that have remarkable neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties. Promising results have been obtained in clinical trials using tetracyclines for major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and major depression. Tetracyclines can inhibit microglial reactivity and neuroinflammation by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling, cyclooxygenase 2, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This drug class also has a broad profile of activity against bacteria associated with community-based pneumonia, including atypical agents. COVID-19 patients are susceptible to secondary bacterial infections, especially those on invasive ventilation. Therefore, we suggest tetracyclines’ repurposing as a potential treatment for COVID-19 neuropsychiatric manifestations.

The observations and measurements of atmospheric NO(2) are poorly investigated in North Africa, therefore, the current study applied a multi-proxy approach to better understand of the ambient environment. This approach is based on satellite observations, chemical and biological analyses, and investigative information during fieldworks. The Aura satellite provides the basic data for the current study with fine resolution of atmospheric NO(2) and O(3) concentrations. The obtained results reveal noticeable increases of atmospheric NO(2) values since the 2011, where its emission reaches the peak during summer season that is characterized by high anthropogenic activities. The study area has many sources for NO(2) emissions, such as the urban region, traffic, as well as the NH(3) emission that is in turn converted to NO(2.) Although the discharged and spreading wastewater (80,000 m(3)/day in summer) has a limited role in NO(2) emissions, it represents an indicator of the anthropogenic activities. The wastewater analyses confirm the occurrence of nitrate (NO(3)(−)), nitrite (NO(2)(−)), and ammonia (NH(4)(+)), which provide an appropriate condition for NO(2) release.

This human coronavirus (HCov-19) has put the world on high alert as the numbers of confirmed cases are continuously increasing. The world is now fighting against this deadly virus and is leaving no stone unturned to find effective treatments through testing of various available drugs, including those effective against flu, malaria, etc. With an urgent need for the development of potential strategies, two recent studies from China using Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) to treat COVID-19 pneumonia have shed some light on a potential cure for the COVID-19 infected patients. However, MSCs, despite being used in various other clinical trials have always been questioned for their tendency to aggregate or form clumps in the injured or disease microenvironment. It has also been reported in various studies that exosomes secreted by these MSCs, contribute towards the cell’s biological and therapeutic efficacy. There have been reports evaluating the safety and feasibility of these exosomes in various lung diseases, thereby proposing them as a cell-free therapeutic agent. Also, attractive features like cell targeting, low-immunogenicity, safety, and high biocompatibility distinguish these exosomes from other synthetic nano-vesicles and thus potentiate their role as a drug delivery nano-platform. Building upon these observations, herein, efforts are made to give an overview of stem cell-derived exosomes as an appealing therapeutic agent and drug delivery nano-carrier. In this review, we briefly recapitulate the recent evidence and developments in understanding exosomes as a promising candidate for novel nano-intervention in the current pandemic scenario.

Intestinal colonisation with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) can precede invasive infection and facilitates spread within communities and hospitals. Novel decolonisation strategies, such as faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), are being explored. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on how the field of FMT for MDRO decolonisation has developed during the past year and to assess the efficacy of FMT for intestinal MDRO decolonisation. RECENT FINDINGS Since 2020, seven highly heterogenous, small, nonrandomised cohort studies and five case reports have been published. In line with previous literature, decolonisation rates ranged from 20 to 90% between studies and were slightly higher for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae than vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Despite moderate decolonisation rates in two studies, a reduction in MDRO bloodstream and urinary tract infections was observed. SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS Although a number of smaller cohort studies show some effect of FMT for MDRO decolonisation, questions remain regarding the true efficacy of FMT (taking spontaneous decolonisation into account), the optimal route of administration, the role of antibiotics pre and post-FMT and the efficacy in different patient populations.

This pilot trial estimated the effect of fiber on gut short-chain fatty acid–producing bacteria in the ICU. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, open label trial. SETTING: Medical ICU. PATIENTS: Twenty ICU adults receiving broad-spectrum IV antibiotics for sepsis. INTERVENTION: 1:1 randomization to enteral nutrition with mixed soy- and oat-derived fiber (14.3 g fiber/L) versus calorie- and micronutrient-identical enteral nutrition with 0 g/L fiber. MEASUREMENTS: Rectal swabs and whole stools were collected at baseline and on study Days 3, 7, 14, and 30. The primary outcome was within-individual change in the cumulative relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid–producing taxa from baseline to Day 3 based on 16S sequencing of rectal swabs. The secondary outcome was Day 3 cumulative short-chain fatty acid levels based on mass spectrometry of whole stools. Analyses were all intent to treat. MAIN RESULTS: By Day 3, the fiber group received a median of 32.1 g fiber cumulatively (interquartile range, 17.6–54.6) versus 0 g fiber (interquartile range, 0–4.0) in the no fiber group. The median within-individual change in short-chain fatty acid producer relative abundance from baseline to Day 3 was +61% (interquartile range −51 to +1,688) in the fiber group versus −46% (interquartile range, −78 to +13) in the no fiber group (p = 0.28). Whole stool short-chain fatty acid levels on Day 3 were a median of 707 μg short-chain fatty acids/g stool (interquartile range, 190–7,265) in the fiber group versus 118 μg short-chain fatty acids/g stool (interquartile range, 22–1,195) in the no fiber group (p = 0.16). CONCLUSIONS: Enteral fiber was associated with nonsignificant trends toward increased relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid–producing bacteria and increased short-chain fatty acid levels among ICU patients receiving broad-spectrum IV antibiotics.

The unidirectional current behavior of our devices originates mainly from the intrinsically different surfaces of the bottom planar and top microtubular Au electrodes while the excellent high frequency response benefits from the charge accumulation in the phthalocyanine molecular heterojunction, which not only improves the charge injection but also increases the carrier density.",2020-07-17,"Li, Tianming; Bandari, Vineeth Kumar; Hantusch, Martin; Xin, Jianhui; Kuhrt, Robert; Ravishankar, Rachappa; Xu, Longqian; Zhang, Jidong; Knupfer, Martin; Zhu, Feng; Yan, Donghang; Schmidt, Oliver G",Nature communications,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17352-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680989/,220612948.0,2020,143

However, the semi-public situation makes it difficult for them to satisfy these existential concerns. In addition, they may not be able to meet a suitable partner or find it difficult to have a relationship for mental or physical reasons. People who live or are cared for at home can also be affected by this problem. Perhaps they can host someone more easily and discreetly than the residents of a health facility, but some elderly and disabled people may be restricted in some ways. This article examines the opportunities and risks that arise with regard to care robots with sexual assistance functions. First of all, it deals with sexual well-being. Then it presents robotic systems ranging from sex robots to care robots. Finally, the focus is on care robots, with the author exploring technical and design issues. A brief ethical discussion completes the article. The result is that care robots with sexual assistance functions could be an enrichment of the everyday life of people in need of care, but that we also have to consider some technical, design and moral aspects.",2020-04-09,"Bendel, Oliver",,,document_parses/pdf_json/e261dfa9b0c85b6d7acfbcc3efc3cf370a36a7c5.json,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04428v1.pdf,215548704.0,2020,193

A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate whether very low birth weight infants (VLBWs) can benefit from OC. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched from Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the date of inception until May 2019. RCTs were eligible if they used OC therapy on VLBW infants. The primary outcomes included ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), late-onset sepsis, and death. The secondary outcomes included the time of full enteral feeding and the length of stay. RESULTS: Eight RCTs involving 682 patients (OC group: 332; non-OC group: 350) were included in the meta-analysis. The results suggested that OC was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of VAP [odds ratio (OR) = 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17–0.88, P = 0.02] and full enteral feeding days (mean difference = −2.66, 95% CI: −4.51 to −0.80, P = 0.005), a potential significance of NEC (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.26–0.99, P = 0.05), a trend toward downregulating mortality (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.34–1.08, P = 0.09) and proven sepsis (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.40–1.01, P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: OC could significantly reduce the occurrence of VAP, and consequently, its routine use should be considered for VLBWs to prevent infectious diseases. IMPACT: OC significantly reduces the occurrence of VAP and NEC in VLBW infants. OC may reduce the incidence of VAP and NEC by increasing IgA levels.

Among the six intestinal epithelial cell types, the Paneth cell is located at the base of the crypt, and it contains numerous granules in its cytoplasm, composed of antimicrobial peptides, such as defensins and lysozyme, and growth factors, such as EGF, TGF-alpha, and Wnt ligands. Together, these elements act in the defense against microorganisms, regulation of intestinal microbiota, maintenance, and regulation of stem cell identity. Pathologies that target Paneth cells can disturb such defense activity, but they also affect the maintenance of stem cell niche. In that way, Crohn's disease, necrotizing enterocolitis, and graft-versus-host disease promote a reduction of Paneth cell population, and consequently of secretion of their products into the lumen of the crypts, making the affected organism predisposed to infections and dysbiosis. Additionally, the emergence of new intestinal cells is also decreased. This review aims to address the main characteristics of Paneth cells, highlighting their multiple functions and the importance of their preservation to ensure bowel homeostasis.

Little is known about COVID-19 testing and vaccination acceptability among homeless-experienced populations. Objective: To understand the facilitators and barriers to COVID-19 testing and vaccine acceptability among homeless-experienced adults. Design: We conducted in-depth interviews with participants from July-October 2020. We purposively recruited participants from 1) a longitudinal cohort of homeless-experienced older adults in Oakland, CA (n=37) and 2) a convenience sample of people (n=57) during a mobile outreach COVID-19 testing event in San Francisco. Participants: Adults with current or past experience of homelessness. Approach: We asked participants about their experiences with and attitudes towards COVID-19 testing and their perceptions of COVID-19 vaccinations. We used participant observation techniques to document the interactions between testing teams and those approached for testing. We audio-recorded, transcribed and content analyzed all interviews and identified major themes and subthemes. Key Results: Participants found incentivized COVID-19 testing administered in unsheltered settings and supported by community health outreach workers (CHOWs) to be acceptable. The majority of participants expressed positive inclination toward vaccine acceptability, citing a desire to return to routine life and civic responsibility. Those who expressed hesitancy cited a desire to see trial data, concerns that vaccines included infectious materials, and mistrust of the government. Conclusions: Participants expressed positive evaluations of the incentivized, mobile COVID-19 testing supported by CHOWs in unsheltered settings. The majority of participants expressed positive inclination toward vaccination. Vaccine hesitancy concerns must be addressed when designing vaccine delivery strategies that overcome access challenges.

However, compliance with stay-at-home orders has varied between countries such as China and the United States, and little is known about the mechanisms underlying the national differences. Based on the health belief model, the theory of reasoned action, and the technology acceptance model, health beliefs and behavioral intention are suggested as possible explanations. A total of 498 Chinese and 292 American college students were recruited to complete an online survey. The structural equation modeling results showed that health beliefs (i.e., perceived susceptibility, severity, and barriers) and behavioral intention played multiple mediating roles in the association between nationality and actual stay-at-home behaviors. Notably, the effect via perceived barriers → behavioral intention was stronger than the effects via perceived susceptibility and severity → behavioral intention. That is, American participants perceived high levels of susceptibility whereas Chinese participants perceived high levels of severity, especially few barriers, which further led to increased behavioral intention and more frequent stay-at-home behaviors.

The objective of this study is to investigate the anti-inflammatory potential of psoralen derivatives (5-hydroxypsoralen, 5-methoxypsoralen, 8-hydroxypsoralen, and 8-methoxypsoralen) in macrophages cells. The results indicated that most psoralen derivatives exhibited significantly inhibited prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production, particularly for 8-hydroxypsoralen (xanthotoxol) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, xanthotoxol treatment decreased the PGE(2), IL-6, and IL-1β production caused by LPS stimulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, Western blot results showed that the protein levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which activated with LPS treatment, were decreased by xanthotoxol treatment. Mechanistic studies revealed that xanthotoxol also suppressed LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of the inhibitor of κBα (IκBα), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in RAW 264.7 cells. The Western blot assay results show that xanthotoxol suppresses LPS-induced p65 translocation from cytosol to the nucleus in RAW 264.7 cells. Moreover, we tested the potential application of xanthotoxol as a cosmetic material by performing human skin patch tests. In these tests, xanthotoxol did not induce any adverse reactions at a 100 μΜ concentration.

In this prospective cohort, we aimed to assess the characteristics of the respiratory system in COVID-19 patients under invasive mechanical ventilation and evaluate their relationship with mortality. METHODS: Fifty-eight COVID-19 patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation between March 11, 2020 and September 1, 2020 were enrolled for the present study. Demographics and laboratory values at baseline were recorded. Respiratory variables such as tidal volume, plateau pressure, positive end expiratory pressure, static compliance, and driving pressure were recorded daily under passive conditions. Further, the median values were analyzed. RESULTS: Median age of the patients was 64 years (58–72). Mortality was 60% on day 28. Plateau pressure, driving pressure, and static compliance significantly differ between the survivors and non-survivors. When patients were categorized into two groups based on the median driving pressure (Pdrive) of ≤15 cmH(2)O or >15 cmH(2)O during their invasive mechanical ventilation period, there was significantly better survival on day 28 in patients having a Pdrive ≤ 15 cmH(2)O [28 days (95% CI = 19–28) vs 16 days (95% CI = 6–25), (log-rank p = 0.026).

Although levels of CO, NO(2), and VOC declined sharply after the lockdown in both cities, with NO(2) showing the highest reduction, ozone concentration in Pune remained unaffected, whereas Mumbai exhibited a mixed trend, touching even a maximum in between the lockdown. On a diurnal scale, the magnitude of O(3) levels during the lockdown period is higher at almost all hours in Mumbai, and in Pune, it is almost identical except during night hours when it is marginally higher in the lockdown period as compared to the normal period. On a whole, the pollution levels were brought down significantly which can be used as a benchmark in the future for the implementation of policies related to air quality management and emission control in Indian megacities by the policymakers.

Anxiety and depression are the most common mental health problems among people during the pandemic, and many studies have reported anxiety and depressive symptoms in college students. However, information on the mental health status of international medical students during this critical period of time has been scarce, which hinders the efforts in making proper policy or strategies to help these students. The present study aims to explore the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms in international medical students in China and to find out the factors that have potential predictive value for anxiety and depressive symptoms. Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out for international medical students during November 2020 at China Medical University in Shenyang, China. Five hundred and nineteen international students were interviewed with questionnaires containing demographic variables, Stressors in school, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Revised Life Orientation Test (LOT-R) and Resilience Scale-14 (RS-14). Univariate logistic regression and stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted where appropriate to explore the predictive factors of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms. Results: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms in the sample population was 28.5% (148/519) and 31.6% (164/519), respectively. Stressors in school (β = 0.176, OR = 1.192, CI: 1.102–1.289), negative coping style (β = 0.639, OR = 1.894, CI: 1.287–2.788) and perceived stress (β = 0.230, OR = 1.258, CI: 1.184–1.337) were found to be the predictors of anxiety symptoms among the international medical students; while gender (β = −0.594, OR = 0.552, CI: 0.315–0.968), stay up late (β = 0.828, OR = 2.288, CI: 1.182–4.431), current place of residence (β = 1.082, OR = 2.951, CI: 1.256–6.931), stressors in the school (β = 0.303, OR = 1.354, CI: 1.266–1.496), negative coping style (β = 0.866, OR = 2.377, CI: 1.516–3.725), perceived stress (β = 0.233, OR = 1.262, CI: 1.180–1.351) were found to be predictors of depressive symptoms. Conclusion: The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was moderate among international medical students in China. The communal predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms were stressors in school, negative coping style and perceived stress; while demographic factors such as gender (male), stay up late at night and current place of residence were found associated with depressive symptoms.

However, anti-COVID-19/asthma comorbidity approaches are restricted on condition. Existing evidence indicates that luteolin has antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and immune regulation capabilities. We aimed to evaluate the possibility of luteolin evolving into an ideal drug and explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of luteolin against COVID-19/asthma comorbidity. We used system pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis to assess the physicochemical properties and biological activities of luteolin and further analyze the binding activities, targets, biological functions, and mechanisms of luteolin against COVID-19/asthma comorbidity. We found that luteolin may exert ideal physicochemical properties and bioactivity, and molecular docking analysis confirmed that luteolin performed effective binding activities in COVID-19/asthma comorbidity. Furthermore, a protein–protein interaction network of 538 common targets between drug and disease was constructed and 264 hub targets were obtained. Then, the top 6 hub targets of luteolin against COVID-19/asthma comorbidity were identified, namely, TP53, AKT1, ALB, IL-6, TNF, and VEGFA. Furthermore, the enrichment analysis suggested that luteolin may exert effects on virus defense, regulation of inflammation, cell growth and cell replication, and immune responses, reducing oxidative stress and regulating blood circulation through the Toll-like receptor; MAPK, TNF, AGE/RAGE, EGFR, ErbB, HIF-1, and PI3K–AKT signaling pathways; PD-L1 expression; and PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer. The possible “dangerous liaison” between COVID-19 and asthma is still a potential threat to world health. This research is the first to explore whether luteolin could evolve into a drug candidate for COVID-19/asthma comorbidity.

This study aimed to gain insights into the processes that influence behaviour change, contributing to improved caring, feeding and food production practices, using a program theory perspective. It also investigated perceived challenges to the sustainability of interventions and potential solutions, in the context of an NSA program in rural Vietnam. Using a participatory approach, data were gathered on impact pathways and perceived outcomes, on elements of program theory that led to behavioural change, as well as barriers and facilitators. Respondents in semi-structured interviews (n = 30) and seven focus group discussions (total n = 76) were selected purposively among program participants. Data was collected and triangulated across several stakeholder groups. RESULTS: The impact pathways (production-consumption, caring and feeding, and home-grown school feeding) envisaged in the NSA program functioned as intended; synergies were revealed. The increased supply of locally produced nutrient-rich foods not only contributed to the emergence of a promising income sub-pathway but also reinforced synergy with the home-grown school feeding pathway. Improved diets, feeding and caring practices, and school attendance were key outcomes of the program. Successful elements were pathway-specific, such as flexibility in implementing context-appropriate agricultural models. Others, such as benefit-driven motivation and improved knowledge, triggered changes in multiple pathways. Role models, increased self-confidence, and change agents were the main process facilitators. The biggest barrier to both implementation and sustainability was the poor socio-economic conditions of the most disadvantaged households. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed the relevance of NSA programs in addressing undernutrition in remote areas by enhancing self-reliance in local communities. The integration of behaviour change activities proved to be a key strategy in the process to enhance the impact of agriculture on nutrition outcomes. Though outcomes and influencing factors are very context-dependent, lessons on what worked and what did not work could inform the design and implementation of effective behaviour change strategies in future NSA programs in Vietnam and elsewhere.",2022-04-11,"Nguyen, Dai Dinh; Di Prima, Sabina; Huijzendveld, Reint; Wright, E.

The present study was conducted to explore MPs' occurrence, abundance and spatial distribution in sediment, water and Schizothorax plagiostomus samples, collected from the Swat River. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy was used for chemical characterization of visually identified MPs by using standard protocols such as digestion using H(2)O(2), density separation using ZnCl(2), vacuum filtration with borosilicate glass micro filter papers and digital microscopy using a stereomicroscope connected with a camera. Range of mass abundance of identified MPs in river sediments, river water, tributaries sediment and tributary water was found to be 0.6–2.5 mg kg(−1), 0.7–3.8 mg L(−1), 0.9–4.5 mg kg(−1) and 0.6–1.1 mg L(−1) respectively. Meanwhile, in Schizothorax plagiostomus digestive tracts samples, it was 0.6–1.9 mg per fish. Numeric abundance of MPs in all matrices was found to be tributary sediment (202 items per kg) > river water (192 items per L) > river sediment (182 items per kg) > fish (153 items per fish) > tributary water (92 items per L). MPs identified on the basis of morphology in all matrices were found to be fragments > fibers > pellets > films > foams. MPs were dominant in all urban stations while their spatial distribution along with the study site was heterogeneous due to the surroundings such as tourist spots, hydrodynamic conditions, and proximity to urban areas, plastic industries and due to recharge by the highly contaminated tributaries. The MPs identified on the basis of size dimensions show that S1 (0.5–1 mm) in all matrices was highest while S2 (1–5 mm) was the lowest. Primary source MPs identified were fibers, films, fragments and foams particles while secondary sources were pellets. Results of ATR-FTIR showed that PE was the most common plastic type identified in all samples followed by PVC, PET, PP and PS.

We examined their impact on the lives of medical students. Methods: A nation-wide cross-sectional survey of college students was conducted from 4–12 February 2020. We enrolled medical students studying public health in Beijing and Wuhan to assess their COVID-19 awareness and to evaluate their mental health status/behaviors using a self-administered questionnaire. We used the Patient Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Health Questionnaire-9 to measure anxiety disorders and depression. We used multivariable logistic regression and path analysis to assess the associations between covariates and anxiety disorder/depression. Results: Of 933 students, 898 (96.2%) reported wearing masks frequently when going out, 723 (77.5%) reported daily handwashing with soap, 676 (72.5%) washed hands immediately after arriving home, and 914 (98.0%) reported staying home as much as possible. Prevalence of anxiety disorder was 17.1% and depression was 25.3%. Multivariable logistic regression showed anxiety to be associated with graduate student status (odds ratio (aOR) = 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2–3.5), negative thoughts or actions (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.4–1.7), and feeling depressed (aOR = 6.8; 95% CI: 4.0–11.7). Beijing students were significantly less likely to have anxiety than those in the Wuhan epicenter (aOR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.8–1.0), but depression did not differ. Depression was associated with female students (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2–3.3), negative thoughts or actions (aOR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.5–1.9), and anxiety disorder (aOR = 5.8; 95% CI: 3.4–9.9).

Therefore, it is necessary the direct attention to their health care needs and related interventions. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have direct impact on older adults’ health and quality of life leading to decreased depression and loneliness, along with empowerment of independent life. Many studies involve cognitive training programs/software based on new technological systems that provide to vulnerable people access to gamified, attractive, cognitive exercises for overall functionality everywhere and at any time. Twenty-four participants (mean age 69.3 years) were assigned to this study. The cognitive training component of LLM Care was used as an interactive software to enhance participants’ cognitive functions. The intervention lasted 12 weeks with the frequency of 2–4 times per week in sessions of at least 30 min. Participants used their personal devices (tablets/laptops) in their own residence, while technical and consulting guidance was provided by LLM Care certified trainers. They were informed about the purpose of the study, while consent forms along with psychological assessments were distributed every 2 weeks to periodically evaluate their psychosocial and mental health conditions. The assessments included the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5), the Short Anxiety Screening Test (SAST), the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Impact Factor Event Scale (IES-R). According to the results, the participants with improved well-being tended to report decreased subjective distress caused by COVID-19, and their engagement with new technologies can potentially minimize the negative outcomes occurred by the current stressful situation, mitigating the effect of hyperarousal symptoms, while increasing their overall well-being. Well-being seems to remain relatively stable among older adults and decreases only when adversities occur, while the usability of the software was perceived as marginally acceptable by participants.

Our understanding of these keystone individuals is largely taken from meticulous field observations and semi-scientific anecdotes. In this study we experimentally test whether the behavioural tendencies of putative keystone individuals shift the collective behaviour of colonies using the social spider Stegodyphus dumicola. Prior studies on Stegodyphus demonstrated that the single best predictor of colonies' collective behaviour is the behaviour of colonies' boldest individual. Here, we probe the causal relationship between the traits of extremely bold individuals and colonies' collective behaviour by experimentally creating colonies of identical size and personality composition in the laboratory and then adding a single individual of varying boldness (the putative keystone individual). Experimentally adding just one extremely bold individual increased the foraging aggressiveness of entire colonies and altered the total mass gained by fellow group members, relative to the addition of a less bold individual. Additionally, our data suggest that bold individuals are capable of such influence because they catalyse variation in the behavioural tendencies of fellow group members.",2014-05-28,"Pruitt, Jonathan N.; Keiser, Carl N.",Anim Behav,,document_parses/pdf_json/0a95b86356881869e3a6245dc7606fa2c8753c1a.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003347214001882; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2014.04.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287335/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347214001882,53150001.0,2014,184

METHODS: A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted using Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database collected during 1997–2005. Patients with incident severe gallstone disease (acute cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, acute cholangitis) and gallstone-related procedures (elective and non-elective cholecystectomy, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]) that led to hospital admission were identified using ICD-9-CM diagnostic and procedure codes. Annual incidence rates of gallstone-related complications and procedures were calculated and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated assuming a Poisson distribution. RESULTS: The hospital admission rate for severe gallstone disease increased with advancing age and the age-standardized rate (95% CI) per 1000 population was 0.60 (0.59–0.60) for men and 0.59 (0.59–0.60) for women. Men had a higher rate of acute cholecystitis, probably due to the substantially lower rate of elective cholecystectomy among men than women. For those aged 20–39, hospital admissions for all gallstone-related complications and procedures increased significantly. For those aged ≥60, incidences of biliary pancreatitis, acute cholangitis, and hospital admission for gallstone receiving ERCP increased significantly without substantial change in the incidence of acute cholecystitis and despite a decreased rate of elective cholecystectomy.

However, few studies have focused on the factors that improve the influence of health messages on social media. OBJECTIVE: To explore the influence of goal-framing effects, information organizing, and the use of pictures or videos in health-promoting messages, we conducted a case study of Sina Weibo, a popular social media platform in China. METHODS: Literature review and expert discussion were used to determine the health themes of childhood obesity, smoking, and cancer. Web crawler technology was employed to capture data on health-promoting messages. We used the number of retweets, comments, and likes to evaluate the influence of a message. Statistical analysis was then conducted after manual coding. Specifically, binary logistic regression was used for the data analyses. RESULTS: We crawled 20,799 Sina Weibo messages and selected 389 health-promoting messages for this study. Results indicated that the use of gain-framed messages could improve the influence of messages regarding childhood obesity (P<.001), smoking (P=.03), and cancer (P<.001). Statistical expressions could improve the influence of messages about childhood obesity (P=.02), smoking (P=.002), and cancer (P<.001). However, the use of videos significantly improved the influence of health-promoting messages only for the smoking-related messages (P=.009).

OBJECTIVES To examine associations between menopausal hormone therapy, suicide attempts, and suicide among midlife and older women Veterans. RESEARCH DESIGN In this longitudinal analysis of national Veterans Health Administration data from women Veterans aged 50 years and above, we used Fine-Gray proportional hazards models to examine associations between menopausal hormone therapy (prescribed in 2012-2013) and incident suicide attempts and suicide (index date-2016). MEASURES Menopausal hormone therapy and psychoactive medications from pharmacy records; suicide attempts and suicide from national suicide data repositories; demographic variables, medical and psychiatric diagnoses, and substance use disorders from electronic medical record data and International Classification Diagnoses-9-CM codes. RESULTS In this national sample of 291,709 women Veterans (mean age 60.47, SD 9.81), 6% were prescribed menopausal hormone therapy at baseline. Over an average of 4.5 years, 2673 had an incident suicide attempt (93%) or death by suicide (7%).

METHODS: This cross-sectional and nation-wide survey of college students was conducted in China from 3 to 10 February 2020. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess psychosocial factors, COVID-19 epidemic related factors and mental health problems. Acute stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms were measured by the Chinese versions of the impact of event scale-6, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, respectively. Univariate and hierarchical logistic regression analyses were performed to examine factors associated with mental health problems. RESULTS: Among 821 218 students who participated in the survey, 746 217 (90.9%) were included for the analysis. In total, 414 604 (55.6%) of the students were female. About 45% of the participants had mental health problems. The prevalence rates of probable acute stress, depressive and anxiety symptoms were 34.9%, 21.1% and 11.0%, respectively. COVID-19 epidemic factors that were associated with increased risk of mental health problems were having relatives or friends being infected (adjusted odds ratio = 1.72–2.33). Students with exposure to media coverage of the COVID-19 ≥3 h/day were 2.13 times more likely than students with media exposure <1 h/day to have acute stress symptoms. Individuals with low perceived social support were 4.84–5.98 times more likely than individuals with high perceived social support to have anxiety and depressive symptoms. In addition, senior year and prior mental health problems were also significantly associated with anxiety or/and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale survey of college students in China, acute stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms are prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multiple epidemic and psychosocial factors, such as family members being infected, massive media exposure, low social support, senior year and prior mental health problems were associated with increased risk of mental health problems. Psychosocial support and mental health services should be provided to those students at risk.",2020-11-13,"Ma, Z.; Zhao, J.; Li, Y.; Chen, D.; Wang, T.; Zhang, Z.; Chen, Z.; Yu, Q.; Jiang, J.; Fan, F.; Liu, X.",Epidemiol Psychiatr Sci,,document_parses/pdf_json/af94cb73f185e8a0914a7d365bd1a1b25a508492.json,https://doi.org/10.1017/s2045796020000931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33185174/,226854423.0,2020,353

Yet, contemporary clustering and dimensionality reduction tools alone are insufficient to analyze or reproduce analyses across large numbers of samples, batches, or experiments. Moreover, approaches that allow for the integration of data across batches or experiments are not well incorporated into computational toolkits to allow for streamlined workflows. Here we present Spectre, an R package that enables comprehensive end-to-end integration and analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data from different batches or experiments. Spectre streamlines the analytical stages of raw data pre-processing, batch alignment, data integration, clustering, dimensionality reduction, visualization and population labelling, as well as quantitative and statistical analysis. Critically, the fundamental data structures used within Spectre, along with the implementation of machine learning classifiers, allow for the scalable analysis of very large high-dimensional datasets, generated by flow cytometry, mass cytometry (CyTOF), or spectral cytometry. Using open and flexible data structures, Spectre can also be used to analyze data generated by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) or high-dimensional imaging technologies, such as Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC). The simple, clear, and modular design of analysis workflows allow these tools to be used by bioinformaticians and laboratory scientists alike.

So, there is a need to forecast the epidemic lifespan, which can help us in taking preventive measures and remedial action on time. These preventive measures and corrective action may consist of closing schools, closing malls, closing theaters, sealing of borders, suspension of public services, and suspension of traveling. Resuming such restrictions is depends upon the outbreak momentum and its decay rate. The accurate forecasting of the epidemic lifespan is one of the enormously essential and challenging tasks. It is a challenging task because the lack of knowledge about the novel virus-based diseases and its consequences with complicated societal-governmental factors can influence the widespread of this newly born disease. At this stage, any forecasting can play a vital role, and it will be reliable too. As we know, the novel virus-based diseases are in a growing phase, and we also do not have real-time data samples. Thus, the biggest challenge is to find out the machine learning-based best forecasting model, which could offer better forecasting with the limited training samples. In this paper, the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) regression model with enhanced predictions of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is proposed. The purpose of the proposed MTGP regression model is to predict the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide. It will help the countries in planning their preventive measures to reduce the overall impact of the speedy and widely spread infectious disease.

OBJECTIVES: To assess mental health outcomes on GPs working during the COVID-19 pandemic and to explore their associations with personal characteristics and features of GP practices. METHODS: Observational cross-sectional study conducted on a sample of GPs working in Verona province (Italy) during the first pandemic wave. Participants were invited to complete a web-based form addressing socio-demographic and work-related information, previous practice organization, practice re-organization during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a set of measures for post-traumatic stress (IES-R), anxiety (SAS), depression (PHQ-9), and burnout (MBI-GS). RESULTS: A total of 215 GPs (38.3% of the eligible population) participated. Overall, 44.7% reported COVID-19-related traumatic events; among these, 35.9% (95% CI, 26%‒46%) developed symptoms of post-traumatic distress.

Multivariate regressions showed that being quarantined or admitted for COVID-19 was associated with all the mental health outcomes considered. Being female, working in rural settings, and having less professional experience were associated with higher anxiety and depression.

Many countries boast high percentages of tourism GDP, with subsequent direct, indirect and induced effects. However, there is a question of how much of that income is sustainable and genuine and how much cost that income incurs during the process of its generation and consumption.

METHODS: A total of 426 critically ill patients in the first affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University from August 2018 to February 2019 were divided into two groups according to the time of admission. Overall, 202 patients in the control group were treated with the routine transfer method, and 224 patients in the observational group were treated with the transfer method based on the CUSP model. The safety culture assessment data of medical staff, the occurrence rate of adverse events and related causes, the time of transfer, and the satisfaction of patients’ relatives to the transfer process were compared before and after implementation of the transfer model between the two groups. RESULTS: Before and after the implementation of the CUSP mode transfer program, there were significant differences in the scores of all dimensions of the safety culture assessment of medical staff (P < 0.05), and the occurrence rate of adverse events and the causes in the observational group were significantly lower than those in the control group (disease-related, staff-related, equipment-related, environment-related) (P < 0.05). The transfer time for Computed Tomography (CT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), operating room, and the interventional room was significantly shorter in the observational group than that in the control group (P < 0.05), while the satisfaction of relatives to the transfer process was significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The implementation of CUSP model for the intrahospital transfer of critically ill patients can significantly shorten the in-hospital transfer time, improve the attitude of medical staff towards safety, reduce the occurrence rate of adverse events, and improve the satisfaction of patients’ relatives to the transfer process.

The first specific mannose-binding lectin-associated serine protease (MASP) inhibitors had been developed from the 14-amino-acid sunflower trypsin inhibitor (SFTI) peptide by phage display, yielding SFTI-based MASP inhibitors, SFMIs. Here, we present the crystal structure of the MASP-1/SFMI1 complex that we analyzed in comparison to other existing MASP-1/2 structures. Rigidified backbone structure has long been accepted as a structural prerequisite for peptide inhibitors of proteases. We found that a hydrophobic cluster organized around the P2 Thr residue is essential for the structural stability of wild-type SFTI. We also found that the same P2 Thr prevents binding of the rigid SFTI-like peptides to the substrate-binding cleft of both MASPs as the cleft is partially blocked by large gatekeeper enzyme loops. Directed evolution removed this obstacle by replacing the P2 Thr with a Ser, providing the SFMIs with high-degree structural plasticity, which proved to be essential for MASP inhibition. To gain more insight into the structural criteria for SFMI-based MASP-2 inhibition, we systematically modified MASP-2-specific SFMI2 by capping its two termini and by replacing its disulfide bridge with varying length thioether linkers.

CD8 T cells play an important role in controlling diseases caused by other coronaviruses and in mediating vaccine-induced protective immunity in corresponding animal models. The spike protein, a main surface antigen of SARS-CoV, is one of the most important antigen candidates for vaccine design. Overlapping peptides were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted epitopes in mice immunized with vectors encoding codon-optimized SARS-CoV spike protein. CD8 T-cell responses were mapped to two H-2(b)-restricted epitopes (S436–443 and S525–532) and one H-2(d)-restricted epitope (S366–374). The identification of these epitopes will facilitate the evaluation of vaccine strategies in murine models of SARS-CoV infection. Furthermore, codon and promoter optimizations can greatly enhance the overall immunogenicity of spike protein in the context of replication-defective human and simian adenoviral vaccine carriers.

However, data about digoxin’s impact in the setting of acute liver injury and sterile inflammation are still limited. Here, we investigated the potential effect of digoxin pretreatments (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, oral) on the severity of acute hepatotoxicity in mice challenged with a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DN; 150 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) for 24 h. Our results indicated that digoxin pretreatments dose-dependently mitigated DN-induced rise of hepatocellular injury parameters and necroinflammation scores. Digoxin, particularly at dose of 0.5 mg/kg, boosted the number of PCNA positive hepatocytes, leading to improvement of the reparative potential in hepatocytes of DN-intoxicated livers. Digoxin’s ameliorative effect on DN-hepatotoxicity coincided with (i) lowering the increased hepatic production and release of the proinflammatory mediators IL-17A, IL-1β and TNF-α, and (ii) impeding the attraction and infiltration of monocytes to the liver, as denoted by decreasing serum MCP-1 and F4/80 immunohistochemical expression. These effects were attributed to reducing DN-induced activation of NF-κB and overexpression of CD98 in the liver. Meanwhile, DN elicited a decline in the hepatic production and release of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-22 and IL-6, which was intensified by digoxin, especially at a dose 0.5 mg/kg.

The unprecedented challenges worldwide implore the urgent development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. Globally, pharmacists have been delivering important public health services as part of the COVID-19 response. It remains to be seen what role they will play once a vaccine is available. This review examines herd immunity and the potential role of the pharmacy profession in mass vaccination against COVID-19, particularly within the Australian context. Aim: A literature review was conducted to review the global development of COVID-19 vaccines, and the Australian healthcare workforce capability and existing policy for mass vaccination and the potential role of the pharmacist. Method: ScienceDirect, Scopus, The National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), Wiley Online Library, PubMed, and Google Scholar were used to search for relevant literature using keywords COVID-19, vaccines, immunisation, herd immunity, pandemic, pharmacist and Australian healthcare. Results: A large portion of the literature was journal articles, and information from governmental and international bodies such as the World Health Organisation were often referenced. Over 20 million Australians need to be immunised through vaccination or acquire immunity through natural infection for the country to achieve herd immunity for COVID-19. When examining state and territory pandemic plans, pharmacists are underutilised. Modifying legislation to allow pharmacists to administer approved COVID-19 vaccines will enable a trained and skilled workforce to be deployed to increase the rate of mass vaccination. Conclusion: In preparation for a successful COVID-19 vaccine, the Australian Government must consider various elements in their vaccination policy. This includes the estimated herd immunity threshold, methods of vaccine delivery, vaccine clinic locations, staffing arrangements and training, and strategies for vaccine prioritisation.

Here, we propose such a new mesoscopic model for the dynamics and flow of ferrofluids, where we couple the multi-particle collision dynamics method as a solver for the fluctuating hydrodynamics equations to the stochastic magnetization dynamics of suspended magnetic nanoparticles. This hybrid model is validated by reproducing the magnetoviscous effect in Poiseuille flow, obtaining the rotational viscosity in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions. We also illustrate the new method for the benchmark problem of flow around a square cylinder. Interestingly, we observe that the length of the recirculation region is increased whereas the drag coefficient is decreased in ferrofluids when an external magnetic field is applied, compared with the field-free case at the same effective Reynolds number. The presence of thermal fluctuations and the flexibility of this particle-based mesoscopic method provides a promising tool to investigate a broad range of flow phenomena of magnetic fluids and could also serve as an efficient way to simulate solvent effects when colloidal particles are immersed in ferrofluids.",2022-04-06,"Ilg, Patrick",,,document_parses/pdf_json/c57b371acbf915cb9c16fcaa8e5e2069aba581aa.json,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03060v1.pdf,247818299.0,2022,188

An assessment was made of the antiviral activities and mechanisms of action of paeonol (PA) and 1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucopyranose (PGG) from Paeonia lactiflora root toward HRV-2 and HRV-4 in MRC5 cells using a tetrazolium method and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results were compared with those of a reference control ribavirin. Based on 50% inhibitory concentration values, PGG was 13.4 and 18.0 times more active toward HRV-2 (17.89 μM) and HRV-4 (17.33 μM) in MRC5 cells, respectively, than ribavirin. The constituents had relatively high selective index values (3.3–>8.5). The 100 μg/mL PA and 20 μg/mL PGG did not interact with the HRV-4 particles. These constituents inhibited HRV-4 infection only when they were added during the virus inoculation (0 h), the adsorption period of HRVs, but not after 1 h or later. Moreover, the RNA replication levels of HRVs were remarkably reduced in the MRC5 cultures treated with these constituents. These findings suggest that PGG and PA may block or reduce the entry of the viruses into the cells to protect the cells from the virus destruction and abate virus replication, which may play an important role in interfering with expressions of rhinovirus receptors (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and low-density lipoprotein receptor), inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor, interferon beta, and IL-1β), and Toll-like receptor, which resulted in diminishing symptoms induced by HRV.

VNN causes damage of necrosis and vacuolation to central nervous system (CNS) cells in fish. It is difficult to identify the specific type of cell targeted by NNV, and to decipher the host immune response because of the functional diversity and highly complex anatomical and cellular composition of the CNS. In this study, we found that the red spotted grouper NNV (RGNNV) mainly attacked the midbrain of orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). We conducted single-cell RNA-seq analysis of the midbrain of healthy and RGNNV-infected fish and identified 35 transcriptionally distinct cell subtypes, including 28 neuronal and 7 non-neuronal cell types. An evaluation of the subpopulations of immune cells revealed that macrophages were enriched in RGNNV-infected fish, and the transcriptional profiles of macrophages indicated an acute cytokine and inflammatory response. Unsupervised pseudotime analysis of immune cells showed that microglia transformed into M1-type activated macrophages to produce cytokines to reduce the damage to nerve tissue caused by the virus. We also found that RGNNV targeted neuronal cell types was GLU1 and GLU3, and we found that the key genes and pathways by which causes cell cytoplasmic vacuoles and autophagy significant enrichment, this may be the major route viruses cause cell death.

Inspections of PSC regimes have been ensuring the continuity of the global supply chain as they enforce shipping to implement the maritime regulations to be safe, secure, and environmentally friendly. OBJECTIVE: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the number of onboard ship inspections has decreased inherently for protecting PSC officersand seafarers, while PSC regimes have developed a policy to focus on a high-risk ship based on historical inspection records. In this context, planning for a “new normal” in maritime transportation, it is essential to realize the change in ship inspection numbers and the trend of deficiency - detention factors for the maritime sector to provide current standards. This study aims to present the difference in ship inspection trends between 2017-2020 by focusing on COVID-19 pandemic outbreak data. METHODS: Comparative analysis with Paris MOU ship inspection & detention figures and entropy-based Grey Relevance Analysis has been used as a methodology to reveal the change in inspection trends after COVID-19. RESULTS: After the pandemic outbreak caused by COVID-19, the number of ship inspections under Paris MOU fell dramatically, however, inspection and detention rate remained the same, also entropy-based Grey Relevance Analysis indicates that detention remarks have also changed compared to last year deficiencies. Detention caused by nautical publication and cleanliness in the engine room has an increasing trend on detentions. CONCLUSION: Inspection statistics indicate consistent figures even during the pandemic outbreak, which indicates the current sample group for Paris MOU inspection is healthy. At the same time, entropy-based Grey Relevance Analysis presents a broader insight that the inspection trend on detention deficiencies has varied. Familiarization with the changing trends in inspections will cause fewer detentions of the ships.

In this paper, we propose a unified sequence-based pneumonia classification network, called SLP-Net, which utilizes consecutiveness information for the differential diagnosis of viral pneumonia (VP), BP, and normal control cases from chest CT volumes. METHODS: Considering consecutive images of a CT volume as a time sequence input, compared with previous 2D slice-based or 3D volume-based methods, our SLP-Net can effectively use the spatial information and does not need a large amount of training data to avoid overfitting. Specifically, sequential convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multi-scale receptive fields are first utilized to extract a set of higher-level representations, which are then fed into a convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) module to construct axial dimensional feature maps. A novel adaptive-weighted cross-entropy loss (ACE) is introduced to optimize the output of the SLP-Net with a view to ensuring that as many valid features from the previous images as possible are encoded into the later CT image. In addition, we employ sequence attention maps for auxiliary classification to enhance the confidence level of the results and produce a case-level prediction. RESULTS: For evaluation, we constructed a dataset of 258 chest CT volumes with 153 VP, 42 BP, and 63 normal control cases, for a total of 43,421 slices. We implemented a comprehensive comparison between our SLP-Net and several state-of-the-art methods across the dataset. Our proposed method obtained significant performance without a large amount of data, outperformed other slice-based and volume-based approaches. The superior evaluation performance achieved in the classification experiments demonstrated the ability of our model in the differential diagnosis of VP, BP and normal cases.",2021-12-02,"Hao, Jinkui; Xie, Jianyang; Liu, Ri; Hao, Huaying; Ma, Yuhui; Yan, Kun; Liu, Ruirui; Zheng, Yalin; Zheng, Jianjun; Liu, Jiang; Zhang, Jingfeng; Zhao, Yitian",Front Oncol,,document_parses/pdf_json/5181e68292d1b1b8439bc52fd4ca552a3683bfc8.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34926297/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.781798,244779968.0,2021,311

Medication affecting folate metabolism may influence the risk of COVID-19 diagnosis and outcomes. Objective: to determine if methotrexate (an antifolate) or folic acid prescription were associated with differential risk, for COVID-19 diagnosis or mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: Case-control analysis of COVID-19 from the population-based UK Biobank (UKBB) cohort. Updated medical information was retrieved on the 13th December 2021. Data from 380,380 UKBB participants with general practice prescription data for 2019 to 2021 were used. Criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis were 1) a positive SARS-CoV-2 test or 2) ICD-10 code for confirmed COVID-19 (U07.1) or probable COVID-19 (U07.2) in hospital records, or death records. By these criteria 26,003 individuals were identified with COVID-19 of whom 820 were known to have died from COVID-19. Logistic regression statistical models were adjusted for age sex, ethnicity, Townsend deprivation index, BMI, smoking status, presence of rheumatoid arthritis, sickle cell disease, use of anticonvulsants, statins and iron supplements. Exposures: Prescription of folic acid and/or methotrexate. Main outcomes and measures: The outcomes of COVID-19 diagnosis and COVID-19 related mortality were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression. The odds ratios from different exposures were compared. Results: Compared with people prescribed neither folic acid nor methotrexate, people prescribed folic acid supplementation had increased risk of diagnosis of COVID-19 (OR 1.51 [1.42 ; 1.61]). The prescription of methotrexate with or without folic acid was not associated with COVID-19 diagnosis (P[≥]0.18). People prescribed folic acid supplementation had positive association with death after a diagnosis of COVID-19 (OR 2.64 [2.15 ; 3.24]) in a fully adjusted model. The prescription of methotrexate in combination with folic acid was not associated with an increased risk for COVID-19 related death (1.07 [0.57 ; 1.98]). Conclusions and Relevance: We report increased risk for COVID-19 diagnosis and COVID-19-related death for people prescribed folic acid supplementation. Prescription and use of supplemental folic acid may confer increased risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and increased risk of death resulting from COVID-19. Our results indicate that methotrexate attenuates an increased risk for COVID-19 diagnosis and death conferred by folic acid.",2022-02-14,"Topless, R. K.; Green, R.; Morgan, S. L.; Robinson, P.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional online questionnaire study, where a 30-item questionnaire was texted via a link to COVID-19 patients who were tested positive previously. A list of anonymised numbers was obtained from different COVID-19 testing centres. The study received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board at the King Abdulla University Hospital/Jordan University of Science and Technology. KEY FINDINGS: A total of 268 patients who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 agreed to participate in this study. Only 22.9% of patients reported taking medications regularly. Almost one-third of respondents (28.7%) indicated that pharmacists were involved in prescribing medicine to patients. Almost half the respondents (49.6%) stated that they or their caregivers obtained information and advice about their medicine from the pharmacists. Only 54.9% of the respondents agreed/strongly agreed that pharmacists have enough scientific information to provide the necessary medical assistance to COVID-19 patients. Patients who work in the medical field, and who always get their medication from the same pharmacy, showed better perception towards pharmaceutical care services that might be provided to COVID-19 patients (P < 0.01).

Design/Methodology/Approach: To highlight the regions that provide 80% of the national food security of Russia, it is worth considering in more detail the indicators of import-substituting food potential for the regions of the Russian Federation. The average indicators of import-substituting food potential in the federal districts of the Russian Federation for 2015–2018 are considered. Using the ranked method, the data is presented more clearly. After ranking using the methodology Olgarenko and Ugryumova (Ugryumova and Olgarenko, .Nat.

In late 2020, several “variants of concern” emerged globally, including the UK variant (B.1.1.7), South Africa variant (B.1.351), Brazil variants (P.1 and P.2), and two related California “variants of interest” (B.1.429 and B.1.427). These variants are believed to have enhanced transmissibility. For the South Africa and Brazil variants, there is evidence that mutations in spike protein permit it to escape from some vaccines and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.

We then present BeCAPTCHA-Mouse, a bot detector based on neuromotor modeling of mouse dynamics that enhances traditional CAPTCHA methods. Our proposed bot detector is trained using both human and bot data generated by two new methods developed for generating realistic synthetic mouse trajectories: i) a knowledge-based method based on heuristic functions, and ii) a data-driven method based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in which a Generator synthesizes human-like trajectories from a Gaussian noise input. Experiments are conducted on a new testbed also introduced here and available in GitHub: BeCAPTCHA-Mouse Benchmark; useful for research in bot detection and other mouse-based HCI applications. Our benchmark data consists of 10,000 mouse trajectories including real data from 58 users and bot data with various levels of realism. Our experiments show that BeCAPTCHA-Mouse is able to detect bot trajectories of high realism with 93% of accuracy in average using only one mouse trajectory.

Whether and how a newcomer can better engage in the community has attracted great interest due to its application in many scenarios. Although some prior works that explore early socialization have obtained salient achievements, they are focusing on sociological surveys based on the small group. To help individuals get through the early socialization period and engage well in online conversations, we study a novel task to foresee whether a newcomer's message will be responded to by other participants in a multi-party conversation (henceforth Successful New-entry Prediction). The task would be an important part of the research in online assistants and social media. To further investigate the key factors indicating such engagement success, we employ an unsupervised neural network, Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), to examine the topic content and discourse behavior from newcomer's chatting history and conversation's ongoing context. Furthermore, two large-scale datasets, from Reddit and Twitter, are collected to support further research on new-entries. Extensive experiments on both Twitter and Reddit datasets show that our model significantly outperforms all the baselines and popular neural models.

Study Design: Eight scenarios were considered. First, it was assumed that the status quo scenario (∼30,000 doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines distributed and administered every week) would continue without Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine. Then, three scenarios of the addition of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine (10,000, 15,000, and 20,000 weakly) were considered. Next, an expansion over the status quo scenario (∼40,000 doses of Pfizer per week) was considered with and without Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine scenarios. Methods: An epidemic dynamics model (namely, a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious Recovered (SEIR) model) is adopted and estimated in this study. In the model, transmission through different phases of the COVID-19 epidemic (susceptible, exposed, infectious, hospitalized, vaccinated, recovered, and dead) is regulated with transmission and clinical dynamics parameters. Key transmission parameters are the population, basic and effective reproduction factors, lengths of incubation periods, pre-infectiousness, infectiousness with and without symptoms, and vaccines’ efficacy rates and coverage. Key clinical dynamics parameters are hospitalization rate among the symptomatic, time from onset of severe symptoms to hospitalization, length of hospital stay, fatality rate among the hospitalized, recovery time among the hospitalized, the time from hospitalization to death. Results: More intense vaccination than the status quo is expected to decrease hospitalizations and deaths in the next three months. However, the magnitude of the decrease in deaths is small, < 3 dozen. Importantly, it is expected that the COVID-19 infection continues to spread. Therefore, social distancing and other COVID-19 protection measures (for example, mask-wearing) must continue – should they be relaxed, a “during vaccination surge” will occur and should be expected in the late April-early May period. Conclusions: Implications for Policy or Practice are Social distancing and other COVID-19 protection measures (for example, mask-wearing) must continue.",2022-01-31,"Patel, N",Value in Health,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301521018015; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2021.11.006; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098301521018015,246046356.0,2022,303

Human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) are a critical source of adipocytes. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in cell fate determination and differentiation. The objective of the present study was to identify and investigate the function and regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs on adipogenic differentiation of hADSCs. METHODS We used lncRNA arrays to identify the prominent differentially expressed lncRNAs before and after hADSC adipogenic differentiation and verified their biological function through antisense oligonucleotide knockdown or lentivirus overexpression. The adipogenic differentiation of hADSCs was assessed by oil red O staining as well as the mRNA and protein levels of adipogenic marker genes through qRT-PCR and western blot. Bioinformatic tool LncPro and immunofluorescence was performed to uncover the interaction between lnc13728 and ZBED3. WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway was evaluated by western blot and immunofluorescence. RESULTS The lncRNA arrays showed that lnc13728 expression was significantly upregulated after hADSC adipogenic differentiation and was correlated positively with the expression of the adipogenesis-related genes in human adipose tissue. Lnc13728 knockdown in hADSCs suppressed the expression of the adipogenesis-related genes at both mRNA and protein level and weakened lipid droplet production. Accordingly, lnc13728 overexpression enhanced hADSC adipogenic differentiation. Beyond that, lnc13728 co-localized with ZBED3 in the cytoplasm and regulated its expression positively. Downregulating ZBED3 had a negative effect on adipogenic differentiation, while the expression of WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway-related proteins was upregulated. CONCLUSIONS Lnc13728 promotes hADSC adipogenic differentiation possibly by positively regulating the expression of ZBED3 which plays a role in inhibiting the WNT/β-catenin pathway.",2021-03-12,"Xu, Haoying; Yang, Yanlei; Fan, Linyuan; Deng, Luchan; Fan, Junfen; Li, Di; Li, Hongling; Zhao, Robert Chunhua",Stem cell research & therapy,,,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-021-02250-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33712067/,232214956.0,2021,264

The current surgical gold treatment standard is intramedullary nail fixation. The Authors present their experience with the D-Nail system for intertrochanteric femur fractures. METHODS: From January 1st to February 21st 2020 (breakout of COVID-19 pandemic) 34 patients were treated with the D-Nail system: 11 with basicervical fractures, 16 with intertrochanteric stable fractures and 7 with intertrochanteric unstable fractures. In 11 cases, a single cephalic screw was used; in 23 cases, two of them were used. Distal locking was executed in 7 patients. Follow-up time ranged from 2 to 3 months. RESULTS: None of the reported intra- or post-operative complication was linked to the fixation device or the surgical technique. Patients were monitored with clinical and radiological checkups using modified Harris Hip Score to accurately evaluate the fluctuations in the rehabilitation period. CONCLUSION: The main advantages of this synthesis device are the proximal hole’s peculiar shape, which allows the possibility to position one or two cephalic screws on the same nail, and the silicon coating, which provides numerous biological advantages. Distal locking was executed in selected cases only, based on fracture type. Optimum treatment involves rapid execution of surgery, minimal trauma during surgery, maximum mechanical stability, and rapid weight-bearing. Although our case number is small and follow-up time brief, our results are encouraging.

Glioblastoma (GBM) patients are among the most vulnerable due to increased incidence in the elderly and the short survival time. A virtual meeting was convened on May 9, 2020 with a panel of neuro-oncology experts with experience using Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields). The objective was to assess the risk-to-benefit ratio and provide guidance for using TTFields in GBM during the COVID-19 pandemic. PANEL DISCUSSION: Topics discussed included support and delivery of TTFields during the COVID-19 pandemic, concomitant use of TTFields with chemotherapy, and any potential impact of TTFields on the immune system in an intrinsically immunosuppressed GBM population. Special consideration was given to TTFields' use in elderly patients and in combination with radiotherapy regimens. Finally, the panel discussed the need to better capture data on COVID-19positive brain tumor patients to analyze longitudinal outcomes and changes in treatment decision-making during the pandemic. EXPERT OPINION: TTFields is a portable home-use device which can be managed via telemedicine and safely used in GBM patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. TTFields has no known immunosuppressive effects which is important during a crisis where other treatment methods might be limited, especially for elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities.

We propose strategies to handle COVID-19 related ICEs, depending on their relationship with malignancy and treatment and the interpretability of data after them. We argue that the clinical trial objective from a world without COVID-19 pandemic remains valid.

In the present work, we estimate the use of these complementary statistical tests (i.e. effect size or confidence interval) in recently published in research articles in clinical and biomedical areas. Methods: The ProQuest database was used to search published studies in academic journals between 2019 and 2020. The analysis was carried out using terms that represent five areas of clinical and biomedical research: “brain”, “liver”, “heart”, “dental”, and “covid-19”. A total of 119,558 published articles were retrieved. Results: The relative use of complementary statistical tests in clinical and biomedical publications was low. The highest frequency usage of complementary statistical tests was among articles that also used statistical hypothesis testing for two-sample comparison. Publications with the term “covid-19” showed the lowest usage rate of complementary statistical tests when all article were analyzed but presented the highest rate among articles that used hypothesis testing. Conclusion: The low use of effect size or confidence interval in two-sample comparison suggests that coordinate measures should be taken in order to increase the use of this analysis in clinical and biomedical research. Their use should be emphasized in statistical disciplines for college and graduate students, become a routine procedure in research laboratories, and recommended by reviewers and editors of scientific journals.

Patients have not been seeking care due to fear of contracting the illness. In an effort to allay patient's fears, our institution has been at the forefront of the Covid-19 vaccine. With a diverse staff in seven radiation oncology clinics across a large metropolitan area, we wanted to know what the level of participation was and what the barriers to vaccination were. Materials/Methods A short survey was designed and sent to the staff who work in the seven radiation oncology clinics for a total of 460 recipients. The survey asked if you had received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. If the answer was no then a list of potential reasons were listed to determine what barriers may exist. Surveys were anonymous with the exception of where the respondent works. Results Of 460 recipients of the survey, we received 181 responses. 81% of respondents had received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Of the 34 respondents who had not received the vaccine yet the top three most common reasons were 1) Lack of access, 2) Lack of trust in the vaccine, and 3) Felt like the vaccine was developed too quickly to be safe. Of the seven centers, we received responses from each center. The centers in the more affluent areas had the fewest staff members who had not received the vaccine. During the course of the survey, we received emails from several staff members who wanted to receive the vaccine but did not currently qualify due to their specific job or age. Those staff members who are employed by the university rather than the hospital and were under 65 did not immediately qualify for the vaccine. Conclusion We found an issue with vaccine distribution within our specific healthcare system that will need further investigation. We also determined that there is an opportunity for more education regarding the safety and efficacy of the vaccine for staff members who have a lack of trust in the vaccine and the process by which it was made.

In the past 10 years, the discovery of adjuvant-mediated induction of the NALP3 inflammasome and its impact on the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 as proinflammatory mediators in the early phases of immune response has been described as an important mechanism for the function of these adjuvants.",2017-01-13,"Lindblad, E.B.; Duroux, L.",Immunopotentiators in Modern Vaccines,,document_parses/pdf_json/c3116b5f9a9a500febbe20c50a770d958fb42188.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128040195000189; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128040195000189,91789099.0,2017,155

This structural snapshot describes the structural bases underlying the pandemic capacity of SARS‐CoV‐2 and explains its fast motion over respiratory epithelia that allow its rapid cellular entry. Based on notable viral spike (S) protein features, we propose that the flat sialic acid‐binding domain at the N‐terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 subunit leads to more effective first contact and interaction with the sialic acid layer over the epithelium, and this, in turn, allows faster viral ‘surfing’ of the epithelium and receptor scanning by SARS‐CoV‐2. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE‐2) protein on the epithelial surface is the primary entry receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2, and protein–protein interaction assays demonstrate high‐affinity binding of the spike protein (S protein) to ACE‐2. To date, no high‐frequency mutations were detected at the C‐terminal domain of the S1 subunit in the S protein, where the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) is located. Tight binding to ACE‐2 by a conserved viral RBD suggests the ACE2‐RBD interaction is likely optimal. Moreover, the viral S subunit contains a cleavage site for furin and other proteases, which accelerates cell entry by SARS‐CoV‐2. The model proposed here describes a structural basis for the accelerated host cell entry by SARS‐CoV‐2 relative to other HCoVs and also discusses emerging hypotheses that are likely to contribute to the development of antiviral strategies to combat the pandemic capacity of SARS‐CoV‐2.",2020-12-14,"Seyran, Murat; Takayama, Kazuo; Uversky, Vladimir N.; Lundstrom, Kenneth; Palù, Giorgio; Sherchan, Samendra P.; Attrish, Diksha; Rezaei, Nima; Aljabali, Alaa A.

The healthcare model for addressing the needs of LGBTQ persons has historically been that of a disease model of care, particularly during the HIV/AIDS crisis, and has recently moved to that of a health equity model in the past 20 years. The LGBTQ community, social work profession, and general medical community worked to create the health care equity model we have today and this paper will discuss how this evolved. The health care equity model addresses the health needs for older adult LGBTQ populations. Older LGBTQ adults are more likely to experience elevated rates of chronic conditions (such as HIV, cancer, diabetes), higher prevalence of anxiety/depression, greater substance abuse, higher economic insecurities, limited community resources, and limited access to health care services compared to heterosexual/cisgender counterparts.

Although the efficacy of ERAS protocol has been well established, its compliance following the resumption of elective services is unknown. Our study aims to assess the level of adherence in the postoperative arm of ERAS in a large district general hospital (DGH). METHODS: Patients who underwent elective colorectal surgery were audited prospectively between 1(st) September 2020 and 15(th) October 2020. RESULTS: The mean age (SD) of the 23 patients audited [11(48%) male] was 65 (16) years. Of the cases audited, 17 (74%) had malignant pathology and 6 (26%) were benign. The overall mean compliance score was 4.91 out of 7 (70%). Nasogastric tube was not used in most patients [22(96%)]. However, compliance was poor with regards to opioid avoidance [2(8%)]. Majority of cases complied with early discontinuation of intravenous fluids administration and catheter removal, 14 (61%) and 13 (57%) respectively. 18 patients (78%) resumed oral intake by the first day after surgery and 21 patients (91%) mobilised by the third postoperative day. Higher compliance was significantly associated with decreased length of stay (p = 0.01) but did not reveal significant association with 30-day morbidity. CONCLUSION: Although the compliance to postoperative ERAS protocol is generally good, our study highlighted a strong need to improve the postoperative practice of opioid avoidance. Stricter adherence should be aimed for as it is associated with shorter hospital stay which is particularly important in the COVID-19 pandemic era.",2021-10-28,"Roslan, Farah; Balsom, Stephanie; Rajangam, Akshaya; Evans, John; Ihedioha, Ugo",Br J Surg,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8574376/,,2021,246

Varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation has already been reported in COVID-19 patients. In addition, adverse events after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination have also been in the context of varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation and directly associated with the mRNA vaccine. We present the first case of CMV reactivation and pericarditis in temporal association with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, particularly adenovirus-based DNA vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 against SARS-CoV-2. After initiation of antiviral therapy with oral valganciclovir, CMV viremia disappeared and clinical symptoms rapidly improved. Since huge vaccination programs are ongoing worldwide, post-marketing surveillance systems must be in place to assess vaccine safety that is important for the detection of any events.

Willingness of persons experiencing symptoms to seek testing may determine the success of this strategy. Methods: A cross-sectional, online survey in the United States measured willingness to seek testing if feeling ill under different specimen collection scenarios: home-based saliva, home-based swab, drive-through facility swab, and clinic-based swab. Instructions clarified that home-collected specimens would be mailed to a laboratory for testing. We presented similar willingness questions regarding testing during follow-up care. Results: Of 1435 participants, comprising a broad range of sociodemographic groups, 92% were willing to test with a home saliva specimen, 88% with home swab, 71% with drive-through swab, and 60% with clinic collected swab. Moreover, 68% indicated they would be more likely to get tested if there was a home testing option. There were no significant differences in willingness items across sociodemographic variables or for those currently experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Results were nearly identical for willingness to receive testing for follow-up COVID-19 care. Conclusions: We observed a hierarchy of willingness to test for SARS-CoV-2, ordered by the degree of contact required. Home specimen collection options could result in up to one-third more symptomatic persons seeking testing, facilitating contact tracing and optimal clinical care. Remote specimen collection options may ease supply chain challenges and decrease the likelihood of nosocomial transmission.

The aim of this study was to investigate key factors for cellular susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the ocular surface cells. METHODS: We combined co-expression and SARS-CoV-2 interactome network to predict key genes at COVID-19 in ocular infection based on the premise that genes underlying a disease are often functionally related and functionally related genes are often co-expressed. RESULTS: The co-expression network was constructed by mapping the well-known angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2), TMPRSS2, and host susceptibility genes implicated in COVID-19 genomewide association study (GWAS) onto a cornea, retinal pigment epithelium, and lung. We found a significant co-expression module of these genes in the cornea, revealing that cornea is potential extra-respiratory entry portal of SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, both co-expression and interaction networks show a significant enrichment in mitochondrial function, which are the hub of cellular oxidative homeostasis, inflammation, and innate immune response. We identified a corneal mitochondrial susceptibility module (CMSM) of 14 mitochondrial genes by integrating ACE2 co-expression cluster and SARS-CoV-2 interactome. The gene ECSIT, as a cytosolic adaptor protein involved in inflammatory responses, exhibits the strongest correlation with ACE2 in CMSM, which has shown to be an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis.

It enables the public health authority to detect and isolate the infected cases from the population, thereby limiting the disease transmission to susceptible people. However, despite the significance of testing in epidemic control, the recent literature on the subject lacks a control-theoretic perspective. In this paper, an epidemic model is proposed that incorporates the testing rate as a control input and differentiates the undetected infected from the detected infected cases, who are assumed to be removed from the disease spreading process in the population. After estimating the model on the data corresponding to the beginning phase of COVID-19 in France, two testing policies are proposed: the so-called best-effort strategy for testing (BEST) and constant optimal strategy for testing (COST). The BEST policy is a suppression strategy that provides a minimum testing rate that stops the growth of the epidemic when implemented. The COST policy, on the other hand, is a mitigation strategy that provides an optimal value of testing rate minimizing the peak value of the infected population when the total stockpile of tests is limited. Both testing policies are evaluated by their impact on the number of active intensive care unit (ICU) cases and the cumulative number of deaths for the COVID-19 case of France.",2021-10-14,"Niazi, Muhammad Umar B.; Kibangou, Alain; Canudas-de-Wit, Carlos; Nikitin, Denis; Tumash, Liudmila; Bliman, Pierre-Alexandre",Annu Rev Control,,document_parses/pdf_json/363d410513ae608c411fa7f5c7d8986c6df70ddf.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3588eab83c09ddca10df028d2269d05e82e40365.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1367578821000742; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367578821000742; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2021.09.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34664008/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15438v2.pdf,237941203.0,2021,226

Here, we used dendritic cells (DC) as vaccine platforms to test GAPDH epitopes that conferred protection against Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium marinum or Streptococcus pneumoniae in our search of epitopes for universal vaccines. DC loaded with GAPDH-L1, GAPDH-M1 or GAPDH-S1 peptides show high immunogenicity measured by the cellular DTH responses in mice, lacked toxicity and were capable of cross-protection immunity against mice infections with each one of the pathogens. Vaccine efficiency correlated with high titers of anti-GAPDH-L1 antibodies in sera of vaccinated mice, a Th1 cytokine pattern and high frequencies of GAPDH-L1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and IFN-γ producers in the spleens.

Symptoms of this viral infection, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), include mild infections of the upper respiratory tract, viral pneumonia, respiratory failure, multiple organ failure and death. Till date, no drugs have been discovered to treat COVID-19 patients, and therefore, a considerable amount of interest has been shown in repurposing the existing drugs. RECENT FINDINGS: Out of these drugs, chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have demonstrated positive results indicating a potential antiviral role against SARS-CoV-2. Its mechanism of action (MOA) includes the interference in the endocytic pathway, blockade of sialic acid receptors, restriction of pH mediated spike (S) protein cleavage at the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding site and prevention of cytokine storm. Unfortunately, its adverse effects like gastrointestinal complications, retinopathy and QT interval prolongation are evident in treated COVID-19 patients. Yet, multiple clinical trials have been employed in several countries to evaluate its ability in turning into a needed drug in this pandemic. SUMMARY: This review attempts to summarize the MOA of CQ/HCQ and its side effects.

When an operation continues for an extended duration, regression of spinal anesthesia often leads to general anesthesia. Here we present a case of extended spinal anesthesia assisted by monitored anesthesia care. CASE PRESENTATION: A 32-year-old male who suffered from persistent pain of the right knee was diagnosed with rupture of the right anterior cruciate ligament. Arthroscopic surgery of the right knee was conducted with spinal anesthesia. A local anesthetic mixture of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 12 mg with 50 μg of epinephrine was used. The surgery took longer than expected with a total anesthesia time of 402 minutes. In the final 30 minutes of surgery, spinal anesthesia regressed and the procedure was completed under monitored anesthesia care (MAC). CLINICAL DISCUSSION: When spinal anesthesia is on regression during the final stage of surgery, the application of MAC safely secures additional operation time. By adopting MAC, the patient avoided general anesthesia and had minimal physiological distress and a rapid recovery. Another benefit of MAC is the reduced consumption of resources. Further, by avoiding endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, the risk of transmission of infectious agents is minimized. CONCLUSION: In situations where spinal anesthesia is regressing close to the end of a surgical procedure, the application of MAC has potential benefits over general anesthesia. These benefits are particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic.",2021-04-29,"Park, Jihyoung; Song, Seung Woo; Kim, Dong Wook; Lee, Kwang Ho",Ann Med Surg (Lond),,document_parses/pdf_json/56cc22639f53df7160ff48834ca0fc2766374571.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2021.102358; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34012546/,234778672.0,2021,247

Diagnostic criteria varied between studies but most signs of VAP have substantial overlap with the signs of C-ARDS making it difficult to differentiate between bacterial colonization versus superinfection. Most episodes of VAP were associated with Gram-negative bacteria. Occasional cases were also attributed to herpes virus reactivations and pulmonary aspergillosis. Potential factors driving high VAP incidence rates include immunoparalysis, prolonged ventilation, exposure to immunosuppressants, understaffing, lapses in prevention processes, and overdiagnosis. SUMMARY: Covid-19 patients who require mechanical ventilation for ARDS have a high risk (>50%) of developing VAP, most commonly because of Gram-negative bacteria. Further work is needed to elucidate the disease-specific risk factors for VAP, strategies for prevention, and how best to differentiate between bacterial colonization versus superinfection.",2021-11-24,"Fumagalli, Jacopo; Panigada, Mauro; Klompas, Michael; Berra, Lorenzo",Curr Opin Crit Care,,document_parses/pdf_json/d8cab37193aa627755091ea661fdd8ec368dc5df.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34932525/; https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0000000000000908,244765703.0,2021,193

Flexible nasopharyngoscopy (FNP), an essential skill for RO residents, requires practice that typically occurs on volunteer patients, introducing the potential for stress and discomfort. We sought to develop a high-fidelity simulator and intervention that provides RO residents the opportunity to develop FNP skills in a low-pressure environment. Methods CT images were utilized to create an anatomically-accurate 3D-printed model of the head and neck region. An intervention incorporating didactic instruction, multimedia content, and FNP practice on the model was designed and administered to RO residents attending the Anatomy and Radiology Contouring Bootcamp. Participants completed pre- and post-intervention evaluations of the training session and model fidelity, and self-assessments of FNP skill and confidence performing FNP. Participants were video-recorded performing FNP pre- and post-intervention. Videos were scored by a blinded observer on a pre-defined rubric. Changes in scores were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results Twenty-four participants from 17 institutions and 4 countries completed the intervention, 50% were female, and most were senior residents. Post-intervention, FNP confidence and FNP performance improved significantly (mean ± SD on a 10-point scale: 1.8 ± 1.8, p < 0.001; 2.2 ± 2.0, p < 0.001 respectively). Participants felt the model was helpful (mean ± SD on a 5-point scale: 4.2 ± 0.6), anatomically correct (4.1 ± 0.9), and aided in spatial comprehension (4.3 ± 0.8). Overall satisfaction intervention was high (4.3 ± 0.8). Participants strongly agreed the intervention should be integrated into RO training programs (4.3 ± 0.8). Conclusions A 3D-printed model and associated intervention were effective at improving FNP performance and the teaching method was rated highly by participants. RO residents may benefit from broader dissemination of this technique to improve trainee performance.",2020-09-04,"Goodman, Christopher D.; Pautler, Justin D.; Balestrini, Christopher S.; Cobos, Santiago; D’Souza, Leah; Eansor, Paige; Jaswal, Jasbir; Nichols, Anthony; Norris, Madeleine; Sharma, Manas; Willmore, Katherine; Warner, Andrew; Murrell, Donna H.; Palma, David A.",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,,document_parses/pdf_json/0e35a5a578a537d19891184e12a010a85bb91808.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S036030162034222X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036030162034222X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.08.063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32891794/,221472294.0,2020,300

A computational work was performed for locating the potential electrostatic interaction sites between kaolinite aluminol and siloxane surfaces and the residues of this protein-fragment ligand, monitoring the possible conformational changes. This hydrated neutralized kaolinite/protein-fragment system was simulated by means of molecular modeling based on atomistic force fields based on empirical interatomic potentials and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The MD calculations indicated that the studied protein-fragment interacted with the kaolinite surfaces with an exothermic process and structural distortions were observed, particularly with the hydrophilic aluminol surface by favorable adsorption energy. The viral units isolation or trapping by the adsorption on the kaolinite nanoparticles producing structural distortion of the peptide ligands could lead to the blockage of the entry on the receptor and hence a lack of viral activity would be produced. Therefore, these findings with the proposed insights could be an useful information for the next experimental and development studies in the area of discovering inhibitors of the global challenged hepatitis and other pathogenic viruses based on the phyllosilicate surface activity.

A BamHI catalytic-deficient mutant D94N/E113K was constructed, purified, and shown to bind and protect the GGATCC site from BamHI restriction. The mutant was fused to a 76-amino acid (aa) DNA nicking domain of phage Gamma HNH (gHNH) NEase.

To acquire full transcriptional activity, TEAD4 requires co-activator, YAP (Yes-associated protein) or its homolog TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif) the signaling hub that relays the extracellular stimuli to the transcription of target genes. Growing evidence suggests that TEAD4 also exerts its function in a YAP-independent manner through other signal pathways. Although TEAD4 plays an essential role in determining that differentiation fate of the blastocyst, it also promotes tumorigenesis by enhancing metastasis, cancer stemness, and drug resistance. Upregulation of TEAD4 has been reported in several cancers, including colon cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer and serves as a valuable prognostic marker. Recent studies show that TEAD4, but not other members of the TEAD family, engages in regulating mitochondrial dynamics and cell metabolism by modulating the expression of mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded electron transport chain genes. TEAD4’s functions including oncogenic activities are tightly controlled by its subcellular localization. As a predominantly nuclear protein, its cytoplasmic translocation is triggered by several signals, such as osmotic stress, cell confluency, and arginine availability. Intriguingly, TEAD4 is also localized in mitochondria, although the translocation mechanism remains unclear.

Individualized positive end-expiratory pressure (iPEEP) along with other lung-protective strategies is effective in alleviating postoperative atelectasis. Here, we compared the best static lung compliance (Cstat) titration of iPEEP with electrical impedance tomography (EIT) titration to observe their effects on postoperative atelectasis in obese patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: A total number of 140 obese patients with BMI ≥ 32.5kg/m(2) undergoing elective laparoscopic gastric volume reduction and at moderate to high risk of developing PPCs will be enrolled and randomized into the optimal static lung compliance-directed iPEEP group and EIT titration iPEEP group. The primary endpoint will be pulmonary atelectasis measured and calculated by EIT immediately after extubation and 2 h after surgery. Secondary endpoints will be intraoperative oxygenation index, organ dysfunction, incidence of PPCs, hospital expenses, and length of hospital stay. DISCUSSION: Many iPEEP titration methods effective for normal weight patients may not be appropriate for obese patients. Although EIT-guided iPEEP titration is effective in obese patients, its high price and complexity limit its application in many clinical facilities. This trial will test the efficacy of iPEEP via the optimal static lung compliance-guided titration procedure by comparing it with EIT-guided PEEP titration. The results of this trial will provide a feasible and convenient method for anesthesiologists to set individualized PEEP for obese patients during laparoscopic surgery.

We included cross-sectional and case–control studies, case series, case reports and correspondence in the analysis. RESULTS: Flame-shaped hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, augmented diameter and tortuosity of retinal vessels were found on funduscopic examination. Peripapillary, macular retinal nerve fiber layer and ganglion cell layer thickness alterations were reported on spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Reduced vessel density of the superficial and deep retinal capillary plexus on optical coherence tomography angiography was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Retinal complications may arise in COVID-19 patients. Although no consensus on presentation is currently available, retinal funduscopy and imaging has shown neuronal and vascular alterations. Systemic neurological complications and microangiopathy are associated with SARS-COV-2; thus, as the retina has a neuronal and vascular component, funduscopy and retinal imaging on COVID-19 patients can provide further insight to SARS-COV-2 disease and the follow-up of patients.",2022-05-11,"Abdolrahimzadeh, Solmaz; Lodesani, Manuel; Rullo, Daria; Mariani, Alberto; Scuderi, Gianluca",Int Ophthalmol,,document_parses/pdf_json/8954c2ffa6ec6f702763690492137cee72b3f118.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-022-02338-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35546380/,248701876.0,2022,247

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to (1) describe changes in healthcare services during the first epidemic bout in people with PD or parkinsonism; (2) compare the occurrence of hospitalization for any PD-related major clinical outcomes in 2020 with 2019; (3) investigate the factors, including changes in healthcare services, associated with major clinical outcomes and death. METHODS: All healthcare services of the province of Bologna and major clinical outcomes were assessed through a record linkage study (ParkLink Bologna) using clinical data and health databases. Same analyses were performed in a random cohort of controls matched for age, sex, district of residence, and comorbidities with the ParkLink cohort (ratio of 1:10). RESULTS: A cohort of subjects with PD (759) or other parkinsonism (192) was included together with a cohort of controls (9,226). All indicators of healthcare services dropped at least below 50% during the lockdown period in all cohorts, mostly impacting physiotherapy in people with PD (−93%, 95% CI 88–96%). In 2020, compared to 2019, a three-fold risk of major injuries (RR 3.0, 95% CI 1.5–6.2) and infections (RR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5–7.2), excluding COVID-19, was observed only in people with PD, and neither in people with parkinsonism nor in controls. Decreased physiotherapy was associated with the occurrence of at least one major clinical outcome (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.1–9.8) in people with PD. Experiencing at least one major clinical outcome was the strongest risk factor for death (OR 30.4, 95% CI 11.1–83.4) in people with PD. CONCLUSIONS: During the first COVID-19 epidemic peak, healthcare services were drastically reduced in a province of northern Italy, regardless of the disease condition. However, compared to 2019, in 2020, only people with PD had a higher risk of major clinical outcomes, that were associated with higher mortality.

Adults who have recovered from intensive care management could develop muscle weakness, neurocognitive impairment, difficulties in managing activities of daily living and to returning to work, and psychological problems such as depression and anxiety. A prospective, observational study was designed. Data were collected from January to December 2018 from a structured follow-up program, at 3 time points after ICU discharge: at seven days, a visit in the general ward, a phone interview at three months and an ambulatory visit at six months. A total of 95 patients were enrolled, 36% female, with a median age of 65 (55–73) years and a median ICU length of stay of 13 (8–20) days. At the seven days follow-up, patients who had a positive Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale showed a significantly longer time of intubation (p = 0.048) and length of ICU stay (p = 0.023). At three months, we observed a significant relationship between a positive Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and a median value of EuroQol-5D (p = 0.048). At six months, we observed that patients who had a positive Post-Traumatic Symptom Scale were significantly younger than the other group.

Kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) have diminished antiviral responses to wild-type SARS-CoV-2 after vaccination, and data on antiviral responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the Omicron variant, are limited. Methods: We conducted a prospective, multi-center cohort study of 51 adult KTRs who received three doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273. Blood and urine samples were collected before and four weeks after the third vaccine dose. The primary outcome was anti-viral antibody responses against wild-type and variants of SARS-CoV-2. Secondary objectives included occurrence of breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection and non-invasive monitoring for rejection using serum creatinine, proteinuria, donor-derived cell-free DNA and donor-specific antibodies. Sera from pre-pandemic healthy controls and KTRs were used for comparison. Results: 67% of KTRs developed anti-wild-type spike antibodies after the third vaccine dose, similar to the Alpha (51%) and Beta (53%) variants, but higher than the Gamma (39%) and Delta (25%) variants. No KTRs had neutralizing responses to the Omicron variant before the third vaccine dose. After the third dose, fewer KTRs had neutralizing responses to the Omicron variant (12%) compared to wild-type (61%) and Delta (59%) variants. Three patients (6%) developed breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infection at a median of 89 days. No KTRs developed allograft injury, de novo donor-specific antibodies or allograft rejection. Conclusion: In KTRs, a third dose of mRNA vaccines increases antibody responses against wild-type and variants of SARS-CoV-2, while neutralizing responses to the Omicron variant remain markedly reduced.",2022-01-06,"Al Jurdi, A.; Benedetti Gassen, R.; De Jesus Borges, T.; Tadeval Lape, I.; Morena, L.; Efe, O.; Solhjou, Z.; El Fekih, R.; Deban, C.; Bohan, B.; Pattanayak, V.; Kotton, C.; Azzi, J.; Riella, L.

However, a gap exists in research focusing on the individual problem-solving effects of example-free instructional explanations and worked examples containing no instructional explanation. This study uses a method in which worked examples are separated from direct instruction to examine the problem-solving effects of individual parts of such instruction, namely example-free instruction and worked examples containing no instructional explanation. Considering the importance of critical thinking skills in the current educational environment, the current study was conducted on a group of university students (n = 32) studying critical thinking in South Korea. Results showed that example-free instruction was more effective for problem-solving than worked examples containing no instructional explanation.

It has revolutionized the rate at which information is shared and enhanced its reach. However, another side of the coin dictates an alarming story. These platforms have led to an increase in the creation and spread of fake news. The fake news has not only influenced people in the wrong direction but also claimed human lives. During these critical times of the Covid19 pandemic, it is easy to mislead people and make them believe in fatal information. Therefore it is important to curb fake news at source and prevent it from spreading to a larger audience. We look at automated techniques for fake news detection from a data mining perspective. We evaluate different supervised text classification algorithms on Contraint@AAAI 2021 Covid-19 Fake news detection dataset. The classification algorithms are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT).

Materiais e métodos Esta pesquisa é um estudo observacional retrospectivo realizado a partir da coleta de dados do Sistema HEMOVIDA (Sistema Nacional de Gerenciamento em Serviços de Hemoterapia) e dos arquivos do Laboratório de Sorologia do HEMOSM durante o período de fevereiro/2020 a julho/2021. A amostra empregada nos ensaios foi o soro dos doadores e a técnica de análise foi a eletroquimioluminescência. Resultados O número total de doadores que apresentaram resultado de sorologia reagente ou inconclusiva para a infecção por HTLV I/II foi de 13 doadores, os quais tiveram todos os seus hemocomponentes descartados. Nessa triagem sorológica, 2 doadores tiveram resultados reagentes e 11 inconclusivos. Destes 13 doadores, 10 são do sexo masculino e apenas 3 do sexo feminino. Além disso, houve 2 casos de coinfecção por sífilis. Discussão O HTLV (vírus T-linfotrópico humano) é um vírus, da mesma família do HIV, que infecta células muito importantes para a resposta imunológica, os linfócitos T. Os dois principais tipos desse vírus são o HTLV-I e o HTLV-II. O subtipo I está relacionado a doenças neurológicas graves e degenerativas e doenças hematológicas, como o linfoma de células T do adulto, enquanto o subtipo II está associado à tricoleucemia de células T. A maioria das pessoas infectadas pelo vírus não desenvolve sintomas ao longo da vida, mantendo, desta forma, uma cadeia de transmissão silenciosa. A transmissão do HTLV se dá por meio do contato com sangue ou outros fluidos corporais de uma pessoa infectada, podendo ser transmitido de forma vertical (de mãe para o filho), pela relação sexual desprotegida ou por meio de uma transfusão sanguínea advinda de um doador infectado, sendo este último motivo a razão pela qual esta doença integra a triagem sorológica para doadores de sangue. Do total de bolsas desprezadas em razão de sorologia reagente ou indeterminada (295 unidades de sangue total no mesmo período) a pesquisa de marcador sorológico para o HTLV I/II representou apenas 4,4% dos descartes. Assim sendo, o HTLV foi a menor causa de descartes relativos à triagem sorológica, mas esta observação não implica na diminuição da importância dessa pesquisa para a garantia da segurança transfusional. Tendo em vista o momento em que nos encontramos, é compreensível que haja insegurança com relação à exposição social para doar sangue, porém é preciso que o trabalho realizado pelos hemocentros continue (com protocolos de segurança) e para isso, é necessária a solidariedade da população para manter os estoques de sangue em níveis adequados. A sorologia reagente ou indeterminada de um doador implica no descarte de todos os componentes sanguíneos produzidos a partir da sua doação, contribuindo para a diminuição dos estoques em um momento em que já há a redução de doações. Conclusão Dessa forma, faz-se de suma importância a conscientização sobre a prevenção dessa doença (e de quaisquer outras doenças transmissíveis pelo sangue) visando tanto a saúde e bem-estar do doador, quanto a garantia do uso de sua doação de forma segura para transfusões em pacientes nos serviços de saúde.",2021-10-31,"Santos, MG; Perdigão, KLV; Birrer, CA; Dorneles, BL; Mendes, NB; Segala, Z; Schimites, PG","Hematology, Transfusion and Cell Therapy",,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2531137921008531; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2531137921008531,239053955.0,2021,526

We aimed to determine if vaccination reduces hospital visits in breakthrough COVID-19. METHODS: This observational cohort analysis compared unvaccinated (UV), partially vaccinated (PV), and fully vaccinated (FV) adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring emergency care(EC)/hospitalization within an eight-hospital system in Michigan. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained from the electronic record. Vaccination data was obtained from the Michigan Care Improvement Registry and Centers for Disease Control vaccine tracker. Primary endpoint was rate of emergency care/hospitalization encounters among patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Secondary outcome was severe disease-composite outcome (ICU, mechanical ventilation, or in-hospital death). FINDINGS: Between December 15,2020 and April 30,2021, 11,834 EC encounters were included:10,880 (91.9%) UV, 825 (7%) PV, 129 (1.1%) FV. Average age was 53.0 ± 18.2 and 52.8% were female. Accounting for the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination population groups in Michigan, the ED encounters/hospitalizations rate relevant to COVID-19 was 96% lower in FV versus UV (multiplicative effect:0.04, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.06, p < 0.001) in negative binomial regression. COVID-19 EC visits rate peaked at 22.61, 12.88, and 1.29 visits per 100000 for the UV, PV, and FV groups, respectively. In the propensity-score matching weights analysis, FV had a lower risk of composite disease compared to UV but statistically insignificant (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38). INTERPRETATION: The need for emergency care/hospitalization due to breakthrough COVID-19 is an exceedingly rare event in fully vaccinated patients. As vaccination has increased regionally, EC visits amongst fully vaccinated individuals have remained low and occur much less frequently than unvaccinated individuals. If hospital-based treatment is required, elderly patients with significant comorbidities are at high-risk for severe outcomes regardless of vaccination status.",2021-09-09,"Bahl, Amit; Johnson, Steven; Maine, Gabriel; Garcia, Martha Hernandez; Nimmagadda, Srinivasa; Qu, Lihua; Chen, Nai-Wei",Lancet Reg Health Am,,document_parses/pdf_json/d1679e483bc57d7054077d8e2e5aceb0099b54f6.json; document_parses/pdf_json/d0b441366cf92c3f34259be5a84d56a4a951594b.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lana.2021.100065; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667193X21000612; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522911/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2667193X21000612,237457156.0,2021,307

This research project sought to describe one network integrating FP-ESS and specialist surgeons, focusing on the role of FP-ESS and their relationship with specialist surgeons, in the surgical care of the Beaufort Delta Region of the Northwest Territories of Canada. METHODS: Using a participatory approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 stakeholders within the surgical system. Interviews were transcribed and reviewed, then imported into NVivo 12 for analysis. First-level coding was performed based on both deductive and inductive reasoning in an iterative fashion during interview collection to develop and refine the codebook. This was followed by second-level categorizing. RESULTS: The FP-ESS physicians provide cesarean section services to maintain a local obstetrics program, to provide gastrointestinal endoscopy, and to provide emergency on-call support, as described by one stakeholder. FP-ESS work together with specialist surgeons through an informal network keeping surgical care as close to home as possible. FP-ESS within this health regions were seen as “a really big gain to the system.” CONCLUSIONS: This study deepens our understanding of rural surgical service delivery, in particular where FP-ESS and specialist surgeons function collaboratively.

With a limit of detection of 1.2 x 104 SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies/ml, Lumipulse showed positive percent agreement (PPA) of 79.9% (155/194) and negative percent agreement of 99.3% (397/400), whereas PPAs were 100% for samples with Ct values of <18 or 18-<25 and 92.5% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30. By three groups, Lumipulse showed PPA of 87.0% (60/69), 81.1% (43/53), or 72.2% (52/72), respectively, whereas PPA was 100% for samples with Ct values of <18 or 18-<25, and was 94.4%, 80.0%, or 100% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30, respectively. RT-PCR positive samples were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 subgenomic RNA and, by three groups, testing showed that PPA was 63.8% (44/69), 62.3% (33/53), or 33.3% (24/72), respectively. PPAs dropped to 55.6%, 20.0%, or 41.7% for samples with Ct values of 25-<30, respectively.

Permitting nonlinear risk effects is important because they are common in the developing world or when worldwide shocks hit economies, like the COVID-19 pandemic. Allowing nonseparable preferences is also important because they admit the incorporation of intergenerational transfer, habit persistence and other specific features of intertemporal decision making. We decompose the risk shock using Davis’s (Int Econ Rev 30(1):131–136, 1989) compensation method and analyze the income and substitution effect of an increase in risk. We prove that the substitution effect is always negative and, therefore, the income effect must be positive and larger in size to have a precautionary net effect. We then apply the method to various sources of risk, such as income, interest rate and wealth risk. We analyze the magnitude of each effect and find the conditions required to guarantee precautionary saving in each case.

METHODS Between 17 March and 1 April 2021, a self-administered online questionnaire was proposed to all persons aged 18 years and older participating in the longitudinal follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies in Geneva, Switzerland. The questionnaire covered aspects of individual and collective benefits, and allowed participants to select contexts in which vaccination certificates should be presented. Results were presented as the proportion of persons agreeing or disagreeing with the implementation of vaccination certificates, selecting specific contexts where certificates should be presented, and agreeing or disagreeing with the potential risks related to certificates. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for factors associated with certificate non-acceptance. RESULTS Overall, 4067 individuals completed the questionnaire (response rate 77.4%; mean age 53.3 ± standard deviation 14.4 years; 56.1% were women). About 61.0% of participants agreed or strongly agreed that a vaccination certificate was necessary in certain contexts and 21.6% believed there was no context where vaccination certificates should be presented. Contexts where a majority of participants perceived a vaccination certificate should be presented included jobs where others would be at risk of COVID-related complications (60.7%), jobs where employees would be at risk of getting infected (58.7%), or to be exempt from quarantine when travelling abroad (56.0%). Contexts where fewer individuals perceived the need for vaccination certificates to be presented were participation in large gatherings (36.9%), access to social venues (35.5%), or sharing the same workspace (21.5%). Younger age, no intent for vaccination, and not believing vaccination to be an important step in surmounting the pandemic were factors associated with certificate non-acceptance. CONCLUSION This large population-based study showed that the general adult population in Geneva, Switzerland, agreed with the implementation of vaccination certificates in work-related and travel-related contexts. However, this solution was perceived as unnecessary for access to large gatherings or social venues, or to share the same workspace. Differences were seen with age, sex, education, socioeconomic status, and vaccination willingness and perception, highlighting the importance of taking personal and sociodemographic variation into consideration when predicting acceptance of such certificates.",2021-11-22,"Nehme, Mayssam; Baysson, Helene; Pullen, Nick; Wisniak, Ania; Pennacchio, Francesco; Zaballa, María-Eugenia; Fargnoli, Vanessa; Kaiser, Laurent; Hurst, Samia; Burton-Jeangros, Claudine; Stringhini, Silvia; Guessous, Idris",Swiss medical weekly,,,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2021.w30079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34846113/,244737565.0,2021,356

SARS-CoV-2 seems to have originated from bats as their reservoir hosts over time. Similar to SARS-CoV, this new virus also exerts its action on the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. This action causes infections in cells and establishes an infectious disease, COVID-19. Against this viral invasion, the human body starts to activate the innate immune system in producing and releasing proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α, and other chemokines, such as G-CSF, IP10 and MCPl, which all develop and increase the inflammatory response. In cases of COVID-19, excessive inflammatory responses occur, and exaggerated proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are detected in the serum, resulting in cytokine release syndrome or cytokine storm. This causes coagulation abnormalities, excessive oxidation developments, mitochondrial permeability transition, vital organ damage, immune system failure and eventually progresses to disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ failure. Additionally, the excessive inflammatory responses also cause mitochondrial dysfunction due to progressive and persistent stress. This damages cells and mitochondria, leaving products containing mitochondrial DNA and cell debris involved in the excessive chronic inflammation as damage-associated molecular patterns. Thus, the respiratory infection progressively leads to disseminated intravascular coagulation from acute respiratory distress syndrome, including vascular endothelial cell damage and coagulation-fibrinolysis system disorders. This condition causes central nervous system disorders, renal failure, liver failure and, finally, multiple organ failure. Regarding treatment for COVID-19, the following are progressive and multiple steps for mitigating the excessive inflammatory response and subsequent cytokine storm in patients. First, administering of favipiravir to suppress SARS-CoV-2 and nafamostat to inhibit ACE2 function should be considered. Second, anti-rheumatic drugs (monoclonal antibodies), which act on the leading cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6) and/or cytokine receptors such as tocilizumab, should be administered as well. Finally, melatonin may also have supportive effects for cytokine release syndrome, resulting in mitochondrial function improvement.

RECENT FINDINGS: Influenza vaccination in HCP provides benefits to both HCP and patients, including reductions in patient morbidity and mortality and decreases in HCP absenteeism. Despite these benefits, influenza vaccine coverage among HCP still falls short of the Healthy People 2020 goal of 90%. As a result, healthcare institutions have used various practices to boost vaccination, including mandatory vaccine policies and requiring non-immunized HCP to wear masks during the influenza season. All of these efforts have been successful at increasing vaccination rates, and employer vaccination requirements have led to rates that meet the Healthy People 2020 goal. Rates of mandatory vaccine policies have increased over time, and several states now have influenza vaccine requirements. However, additional study into how these policies improve patient outcomes is needed.

Attempting to contain infection, China banned travel to and from Wuhan city on 23 January and implemented a national emergency response. Here we evaluate the spread and control of the epidemic based on a unique synthesis of data including case reports, human movement and public health interventions. The Wuhan shutdown slowed the dispersal of infection to other cities by an estimated 2.91 days (95%CI: 2.54-3.29), delaying epidemic growth elsewhere in China. Other cities that implemented control measures pre-emptively reported 33.3% (11.1-44.4%) fewer cases in the first week of their outbreaks (13.0; 7.1-18.8) compared with cities that started control later (20.6; 14.5-26.8). Among interventions investigated here, the most effective were suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings. The national emergency response delayed the growth and limited the size of the COVID-19 epidemic and, by 19 February (day 50), had averted hundreds of thousands of cases across China.

Rapid detection of foot‐and‐mouth disease virus (FMDV) is critical to containing an FMD outbreak. Availability of a rapid, highly sensitive and specific, yet simple and field‐deployable assay would support local decision‐making during an FMDV outbreak. Here we report validation of a novel reverse transcription‐insulated isothermal PCR (RT‐iiPCR) assay that can be performed on a commercially available, compact and portable POCKIT (™) analyser that automatically analyses data and displays ‘+’ or ‘−’ results. The FMDV RT‐iiPCR assay targets the 3D region of the FMDV genome and was capable of detecting 9 copies of in vitro‐transcribed RNA standard with 95% confidence. It accurately identified 63 FMDV strains belonging to all seven serotypes and showed no cross‐reactivity with viruses causing similar clinical diseases in cloven‐hoofed animals.

This regimen is currently highly prevalent in the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has brought about increased concern about how best to safely avoid brachial plexus injuries when caring for unconscious proned patients. METHODS A review of the published literature on brachial plexus injuries secondary to proning ventilated patients was performed. This was combined with a review of available international critical care guidelines in order to produce a succinct set of guidelines to aid critical care departments in reducing brachial plexus injuries during these challenging times. DISCUSSION There is no one manner in which prone positioning an unconscious patient can be made universally safe. This paper provides 6 key steps to reducing the incidence of brachial plexus injuries while proning and suggests a safe and sensible management and referral pathway for the conscious patient in which a brachial plexus injury is identified. CONCLUSION There is in truth no completely safe position for every patient and certainly there will be anomalies in anatomy that will predispose certain individuals to nerve injury. Thus the injury rate cannot be reduced to zero but an understanding of the principles of protection will inform those undertaking positioning.,2020-09-22,"Simpson, Ashley I; Vaghela, Kalpesh R; Brown, Hazel; Adams, Kate; Sinisi, Marco; Fox, Michael; Quick, Tom",Journal of intensive care medicine,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/0885066620954787; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32959717/,221845043.0,2020,210

Methods Probable SARS cases occurring between November 2002 and May 2003 in mainland China were compiled from different sources and geo‐coded into a geographical information database based on onset location. Spatial analyses including kernel density estimation, and spatial statistical and tracking analyses were performed to characterise the spatiotemporal distribution of SARS cases based on onset location/date. SARS cases that got infected in Beijing but were reported in three provinces surrounding Beijing were mapped, and logistic regression using a ‘case–control’ design at the county level was performed to analyse the impact of travel‐related risk factors in the diffusion pattern. Results The SARS epidemic in mainland China spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two areas: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing with its surrounding areas in Shanxi Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomic Region, Hebei Province and Tianjin. Counties in the neighbourhood of Beijing that were crossed by a national highway or inter‐provincial freeway showed the highest risk of acquiring SARS infections, even after correction for population density and medical staff density. Being intersected by a railway did not significantly associate with risk of SARS. Conclusions This study provides the first complete documentation of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the SARS epidemic in mainland China. Our analyses confirmed that SARS had benefited from national highways and inter‐provincial freeways for its spread from epicentres to neighbouring areas, whereas trains showed no significant association.

Few studies have described COVID-19 oral manifestations.

Yet forty years after the World Health Assembly adopted the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes (The Code), many countries are still to fully implement its provisions into national law. Furthermore, despite The Code, commercial milk formula (CMF) markets have markedly expanded. In this paper, we adopt the Philippines as a case study to understand the battle for national Code implementation. In particular, we investigate the market and political strategies used by the baby food industry to shape the country’s ‘first-food system’, and in doing so, promote and sustain CMF consumption. We further investigate how breastfeeding coalitions and advocates have resisted these strategies, and generated political commitment for a world-leading breastfeeding policy framework and protection law (the ‘Milk Code’). We used a case study design and process tracing method, drawing from documentary and interview data. RESULTS: The decline in breastfeeding in the Philippines in the mid-twentieth Century associated with intensive BMS marketing via health systems and consumer advertising. As regulations tightened, the industry more aggressively promoted CMFs for older infants and young children, thereby ‘marketing around’ the Milk Code. It established front groups to implement political strategies intended to weaken the country’s breastfeeding policy framework while also fostering a favourable image. This included lobbying government officials and international organizations, emphasising its economic importance and threats to foreign investment and trade, direct litigation against the government, messaging that framed marketing in terms of women’s choice and empowerment, and forging partnerships. A resurgence in breastfeeding from the mid-1980s onwards reflected strengthening political commitment for a national breastfeeding policy framework and Milk Code, resulting in-turn, from collective actions by breastfeeding coalitions, advocates and mothers. CONCLUSION: The Philippines illustrates the continuing battle for worldwide Code implementation, and in particular, how the baby food industry uses and adapts its market and political practices to promote and sustain CMF markets. Our results demonstrate that this industry’s political practices require much greater scrutiny. Furthermore, that mobilizing breastfeeding coalitions, advocacy groups and mothers is crucial to continually strengthen and protect national breastfeeding policy frameworks and Code implementation.

In fact, influenza virus itself does not make critical contribution to mortality induced by influenza, but ""cytokine storm"" produced by the excessive immune response triggered by the virus can result in inflammatory reaction of lung tissues and fatal lung tissue injury, and thus increase influenza mortality. Therefore, besides antiviral drugs, immunosuppression drugs should also be included in infection treatment. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Complement is the center of inflammatory reaction. If complement system is over activated, the body will have strong inflammatory reaction or tissue injury, resulting in pathological process. Many studies have proved that, inflammatory injury of lung tissues caused by influenza virus is closely related to complement activation. Therefore, inhibiting complement activation can significantly reduce inflammatory injury in lung tissues. As complement is both a physiological defense and pathological damage medium, systematic inhibition may result in side effects including infection. Therefore, we design targeting complement inhibitors for complement activation sites, i.e. with CR2 as targeting vector, complement inhibitors like CD59 and Crry are targeted to inflammatory sites to specially inhibit the complement activation in local injury, thus local inflammatory reaction is inhibited. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: CR2-CD59 and CR2-Crry targeting complement inhibitors are fusion-expressed, and their biological activity is examined via in vivo and in vitro tests. CR2 targeting complement inhibitors are used to treat mouse influenza viral pneumonia model, with PBS treatment group as the control. The survival and lung tissue injury of the mice is observed and the effect of CR2 targeting complement inhibitors on pneumonia induced by influenza virus is evaluated. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: CR2 targeting complement inhibitors are expected to be ideal drugs for viral pneumonia.",2010-02-09,"Zhang, Chuanfu; Xu, Yuanyong; Jia, Leili; Yang, Yutao; Wang, Yong; Sun, Yansong; Huang, Liuyu; Qiao, Fei; Tomlinson, Stephen; Liu, Xuelin; Zhou, Yusen; Song, Hongbin",Virol J,,document_parses/pdf_json/c92099607cfae94a24e03a111d12994535cc2eae.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-422x-7-30; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20144216/,17363798.0,2010,283

While induction of adaptive antiviral immunity via vaccination holds promise for combatting the pandemic, the emergence of new potentially more transmissible and vaccine-resistant variants of SARS-CoV-2 is an ever-present threat. Thus, it remains essential to better understand innate immune mechanisms that are active against the virus. One component of the innate immune system with broad anti-pathogen, including antiviral, activity is a group of cationic immune peptides termed defensins. The defensins’ ability to neutralize enveloped and non-enveloped viruses and to inactivate numerous bacterial toxins correlate with their ability to promote the unfolding of thermodynamically pliable proteins. Accordingly, we found that human neutrophil a-defensin HNP1 and retrocyclin RC-101 destabilize SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and interfere with Spike-mediated membrane fusion and SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. We show that HNP1 binds to Spike with submicromolar affinity. Although binding of HNP1 to serum albumin is more than 20-fold weaker, serum reduces the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of HNP1. At high concentrations of HNP1, its ability to inactivate the virus was preserved even in the presence of serum.

In Germany, there are different approaches to obtain a structured SO procedure: SO programs by health insurers and SOs according to the SO Directive. Through a direct survey of the population, we aimed to assess how structured SOs should be provided to fulfil patients’ needs. METHODS: A stratified sample of 9990 adults (≥18 years) living in the federal states of Berlin and Brandenburg (Germany) were initially contacted by post in April and sent a reminder in May 2020. The survey results were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Among 1349 participants (response rate 14%), 56% were female and the median age was 58 years (interquartile range (IQR) 44–69). Participants wanted to be informed directly and personally about the possibility of obtaining an SO (89%; 1201/1349). They preferred to be informed by their physician (93%; 1249/1349). A majority of participants would consider it important to obtain an SO for oncological indications (78%; 1049/1349). Only a subset of the participants would seek an SO via their health insurer or via an online portal (43%; 577/1349 and 16%; 221/1349). A personally delivered SO was the preferred route of SO delivery, as 97% (1305/1349) would (tend to) consider this way of obtaining an SO. Participants were asked to imagine having moderate knee pain for years, resulting in a treatment recommendation for knee joint replacement. They were requested to rate potential qualification criteria for a physician providing the SO. The criteria rated to be most important were experience with the recommended diagnosis/treatment (criterion (very) important for 93%; 1257/1349) and knowledge of the current state of research (criterion (very) important for 86%; 1158/1349). Participants were willing to travel 60 min (median; IQR 60–120) and wait 4 weeks (median; IQR 2–4) for their SO in the hypothetical case of knee pain. CONCLUSION: In general, SOs were viewed positively. We found that participants have clear preferences regarding SOs. We propose that these preferences should be taken into account in the future design and development of SO programs.

Similarly, pseudoviruses bearing spike protein derived from either the bat raTG13 or pangolin GX, two closely related animal coronaviruses, utilized ACE2 of a diverse range of animal species to gain entry. Removal of PRRA from SARS-CoV-2 Spike displayed distinct effects on pseudoviral entry into different cell types.

Serious games can be used to train clinical reasoning. However, only few studies have used outcomes beyond student satisfaction, and most of the published evidence is based on short-term follow-up. This study investigated the effectiveness of a digital simulation of an emergency ward regarding appropriate clinical decision-making. METHODS: In this prospective trial that ran from summer 2017 to winter 2018/19 at Göttingen Medical University Centre, a total of 178 students enrolled in either the fourth or the fifth year of undergraduate medical education took six 90-min sessions of playing a serious game (‘training phase’) in which they managed virtual patients presenting with various conditions. Learning outcome was assessed by analysing log-files of in-game activity (including choice of diagnostic methods, differential diagnosis and treatment initiation) with regard to history taking and patient management in three virtual patient cases: Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), pulmonary embolism (PE) and hypertensive crisis. Fourth-year students were followed up for 1.5 years, and their final performance was compared to the performance of students who had never been exposed to the game but had otherwise taken the same five-year undergraduate course. RESULTS: During the training phase, overall performance scores increased from 57.6 ± 1.1% to 65.5 ± 1.2% (p < 0.001; effect size 0.656). Performance remained stable over 1.5 years, and the final assessment revealed a strong impact of ever-exposure to the game on management scores (72.6 ± 1.2% vs. 63.5 ± 2.1%, p < 0.001; effect size 0.811). Pre-exposed students were more than twice as likely to correctly diagnose NSTEMI and PE and showed significantly greater adherence to guideline recommendations (e.g., troponin measurement and D-dimer testing in suspected PE). CONCLUSIONS: The considerable difference observed between previously exposed and unexposed students suggests a long-term effect of using the game although retention of specific virtual patient cases rather than general principles might partially account for this effect. Thus, the game may foster the implementation of guideline recommendations.

Nintedanib is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGF, PDGF, FGF, and TGF-β receptors with proved efficacy in anti-angiogenesis and in treating various types of cancers. In this study, we investigated the effects of nintedanib on keloid fibroblasts in both in vitro and ex vivo models. Keloid fibroblasts were prepared from 54 keloid scar samples in active stages collected from 49 patients. We found that nintedanib (1−4 μM) dose-dependently suppressed cell proliferation, induced G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest, and inhibited migration and invasion of keloid fibroblasts. The drug also significantly inhibited the gene and protein expression of collagen I (COL-1) and III (COL-3), fibronectin (FN), and connective growth factor (CTGF), as well as the gene expression of other pathological factors, such as alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), FK506-binding protein 10 (FKBP10), and heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) in keloid fibroblasts. Furthermore, nintedanib treatment significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of p38, JNK, ERK, STAT3, and Smad, enhanced endocytosis of various growth factor receptors. Using an ex vivo tissue explant model, we showed that nintedanib significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and collagen production.

The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS), in consultation with sport partners (National Institute Network (NIN) Directors, NIN Chief Medical Officers (CMOs), National Sporting Organisation (NSO) Presidents, NSO Performance Directors and NSO CMOs), has developed a framework to inform the resumption of sport. National Principles for Resumption of Sport were used as a guide in the development of ‘the AIS Framework for Rebooting Sport in a COVID-19 Environment’ (the AIS Framework); and based on current best evidence, and guidelines from the Australian Federal Government, extrapolated into the sporting context by specialists in sport and exercise medicine, infectious diseases and public health. The principles outlined in this document apply to high performance/professional, community and individual passive (non-contact) sport. The AIS Framework is a timely tool of minimum baseline of standards, for ‘how’ reintroduction of sport activity will occur in a cautious and methodical manner, based on the best available evidence to optimise athlete and community safety. Decisions regarding the timing of resumption (the ‘when’ ) of sporting activity must be made in close consultation with Federal, State/Territory and Local Public Health Authorities. The priority at all times must be to preserve public health, minimising the risk of community transmission.",2020-05-06,"Hughes, David; Saw, Richard; Perera, Nirmala Kanthi Panagodage; Mooney, Mathew; Wallett, Alice; Cooke, Jennifer; Coatsworth, Nick; Broderick, Carolyn",J Sci Med Sport,,document_parses/pdf_json/a83d5ea453f8c6308b4c138b5e9abbb1d0682eca.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsams.2020.05.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1440244020305272?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1440244020305272; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32451268/,218503595.0,2020,261

During spore formation in Gram-positive bacteria, a transport system called the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex also assembles in the double membrane that surrounds the forespore following its endocytosis by the mother cell. The presence of RBM domains in some of the SpoIIIA proteins led to the hypothesis that they would assemble into rings connecting the two membranes and form a conduit between the mother cell and forespore. Among them, SpoIIIAG forms homo-oligomeric rings in vitro but the oligomerization of other RBM-containing SpoIIIA proteins, including SpoIIIAH, remains to be demonstrated. In this work, we identified RBM domains in the YhcN/YlaJ family of proteins that are not related to the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex. We solved the crystal structure of YhcN from Bacillus subtilis, which confirmed the presence of a RBM fold, flanked by additional secondary structures. As the protein did not show any oligomerization ability in vitro, we investigated the structural determinants of ring formation in SpoIIIAG, SpoIIIAH and YhcN. We showed that in vitro, the conserved core of RBM domains alone is not sufficient for oligomerization while the β-barrel forming region in SpoIIIAG forms rings on its own.

The Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway participates in the development and progression of DN. Among the different mechanisms involved in JAK/STAT negative regulation, the family of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins has been proposed as a new target for DN. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of SOCS1 mimetic peptide in a mouse model of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) with progressive DN. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Six-week-old BTBR (black and tan brachyuric) mice with the ob/ob (obese/obese) leptin-deficiency mutation were treated for 7 weeks with two different doses of active SOCS1 peptide (MiS1 2 and 4 µg/g body weight), using inactive mutant peptide (Mut 4 µg) and vehicle as control groups. At the end of the study, the animals were sacrificed to obtain blood, urine and kidney tissue for further analysis. RESULTS Treatment of diabetic mice with active peptide significantly decreased urine albumin to creatinine ratio by up to 50%, reduced renal weight, glomerular and tubulointerstitial damage, and restored podocyte numbers. Kidneys from treated mice exhibited lower inflammatory infiltrate, proinflammatory gene expression and STAT activation. Concomitantly, active peptide administration modulated redox balance markers and reduced lipid peroxidation and cholesterol transporter gene expression in diabetic kidneys. CONCLUSION Targeting SOCS proteins by mimetic peptides to control JAK/STAT signaling pathway ameliorates albuminuria, morphological renal lesions, inflammation, oxidative stress and lipotoxicity, and could be a therapeutic approach to T2D kidney disease.",2020-09-01,"Opazo-Ríos, Lucas; Sanchez Matus, Yenniffer; Rodrigues-Díez, Raúl R; Carpio, Daniel; Droguett, Alejandra; Egido, Jesús; Gomez-Guerrero, Carmen; Mezzano, Sergio",BMJ open diabetes research & care,,,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjdrc-2020-001242; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32900697/,221573272.0,2020,248

METHODS: We used TriNetX, a global health collaborative clinical research platform collecting real-time electronic medical records data, which has one of the largest known global COVID-19 database. We included patients with chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disorders (aNMD) [myasthenia gravis (MG), inflammatory myositis, and chronic inflammatory neuropathies (CIN)] and MS, based on the International Classification of Disease-10 (ICD-10) coding for one year before January 20th, 2020.

The impact of age on COPD is well known, but the COPD risk of the aging process in the lungs remains unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the COPD risk of the aging process in the lungs, providing an early COPD risk decision for adults. METHODS: COPD risk is evaluated for adults to make an early COPD risk decision from the perspective of lung radiomics features. First, the subjects are divided into four groups according to the COPD stages. Their ages are divided into eight equal age intervals in each group. Second, four survival Cox models are established based on the lung radiomics features to evaluate the risk probability from COPD stage 0 to suffering COPD and COPD stages. Finally, four risk ranks are defined by equally dividing the COPD risk probability from 0 to 1. Subsequently, the COPD risk at different stages is evaluated with varying age intervals to provide an early COPD risk decision. RESULTS: The evaluation metrics area under the curve (AUC)/C index of four survival Cox models are 0.87/0.94, 0.84/0.83, 0.94/0.89, and 0.97/0.86, respectively, showing the effectiveness of the models. The risk rank levels up every 5 years for the subjects who had suffered COPD after 60. For the subjects with COPD stage 0, the risk rank of suffering COPD stage I levels up every 5 years after the age of 65 years, and the risk rank of suffering COPD stages II and III & IV levels up every 5 years after the age of 70 years.

This review summarises the state of the art of nanotechnology-based affinity biosensors for SARS, MERS and COVID-19 detection. The nanobiosensors are antibody- or DNA-based biosensors with electrochemical, optical or FET-based transduction. Various kinds of nanomaterials, such as metal nanoparticles, nanowires and graphene, have been merged to the affinity biosensors to enhance their analytical performances. The advantages of the use of the nanomaterials are highlighted, and the results compared with those obtained using non-nanostructured biosensors. A critical comparison with conventional methods, such as RT-PCR and ELISA, is also reported. It is hoped that this review will provide interesting information for the future development of new reliable nano-based platforms for point-of-care diagnostic devices for COVID-19 prevention and control.

In this study, we report that virulent VEEV efficiently infects cultured normal human astrocytes, three different murine astrocyte cell lines and astrocytes in the mouse brain. The attenuation of virus replication positively correlates with the increased levels of production of IL-8, IL-17, IFN-gamma and IP-10. In addition, VEEV infection induces release of basic fibroblast growth factor and production of potent chemokines such as RANTES and MIP-1-beta from cultured human astrocytes.

Modified minimally invasive surgical technique (M-MIST) is designed to deal with isolated interdental intrabony defects, and has achieved satisfactory periodontal regenerative effect. Bio-Oss Collagen, as a bioactive material, has been applied for periodontal regeneration. It is similar to human cancellous bone, with the ability to promote bone formation; furthermore, it has exceptional plasticity and spatial stability. The combination of different materials and techniques has become a research hotspot in recent years. By combining the superiority of regeneration technology and materials, better regenerative effect can be achieved. This study will search for differences between M-MIST combined with Bio-Oss Collagen, and M-MIST alone in regeneration therapy for intrabony defects. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The present research is designed as a two-group parallel randomised controlled trial. The total number of patients is 40. The patients will be randomly assigned to two groups, with 20 participants in each group, for further periodontal regenerative surgery. Test group: M-MIST plus Bio-Oss Collagen. Control group: M-MIST. After 12 months, the measurement indices will be recorded; these will include clinical attachment gain and radiographical intrabony defect depth change as the primary results, and secondary outcomes of full-mouth plaque scores, probing depth, full-mouth bleeding scores, gingival recession, mobility, gingival papilla height and Visual Analogue Scale. The paired samples t-test will be applied to detect any difference between baseline and 1-year registrations. A general linear model will be performed to study the relationship between the secondary and the primary outcome. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The present research has received approval from the Ethics Committee of Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology (PKUSSIRB-202053002). Data of the present research will be registered with the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Additionally, we will disseminate the results through scientific dental journals.

The aims of this study were to (1) describe the prepartum and calf-rearing systems, as well as the management practices that may influence calf welfare in pastured dairy herds in Uruguay, (2) estimate the annual calf mortality risk from birth to weaning, and (3) identify the primary clinical disease syndromes shown by the calves before death. A survey comprising a farm visit and a questionnaire was conducted on 225 randomly selected dairies with >30 milking cows, in 3 strata (31-99, 100-299, and ≥300 milking cows) of 6 Uruguayan departments where dairies are concentrated. Retrospective information from July 2013 to June 2014 was collected. A descriptive analysis was performed and results were inferred into the national dairy cattle population. Several management practices that could contribute to poor calf welfare were identified in a large proportion of farms. The annual calf mortality risk (calves that died between birth and weaning/calves born death or alive × 100, n = 149 farms) was 15.2%. Age at weaning averaged 75 d. Farmers reported that the most common clinical syndromes were diarrhea and respiratory disease in 85.2% and 47.5% of the farms, respectively. There was no continuous veterinary advice in 61.3% of the farms, 20.0% lacked data records, 38.5% had poor drainage in the prepartum area with waterlogging after rainfall, 52.1% monitored the prepartum area ≤2 times per day during the calving season, 65.1% did not perform navel antisepsis on newborns, 62.3% separated the calves from their dams at >24 h postpartum, 95.2% did not have a colostrum management program, 72.4% did not rotate the calf-rearing areas, 59.0% did not disinfect the calf feeders, 85.7% did not have staff dedicated exclusively to calf rearing, and 39.8% did not separate sick from healthy calves.
